GIG: Monday at Manhattan Inn 
“Pavo” is a Spanish word for “peacock,” an elegant, colorful bird. Pavo Pavo is the name of this Brooklyn band that makes elegant, colorful music. This song “Ran Ran Run” bounces all over the place, in the best possible way. And if there’s a better reason to listen to a song in the summer than because it sounds like the Beach Boys, we don’t know it. Pavo Pavo plays tonight at Manhattan Inn.
