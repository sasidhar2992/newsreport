When Story met Michael Buble 
Monday 22 Aug 2016 7:43 p.m. By Amanda Gillies 
Of all the twists and turn in the pop industry this year, you probably never thought you&apos;d pair rapping with Michael Buble. 
He&apos;s got a rapper in his latest single, called &apos;Nobody But Me&apos;, soon to be followed by an album of the same name. 
Story went to Canada for the New Zealand exclusive to speak to the crooner about the new album and his life as a touring parent, and he insisted on talking about his favourite film of all time, which happens to be a Kiwi film. 
Story went to meet the singer who we think should become an honorary Kiwi.
