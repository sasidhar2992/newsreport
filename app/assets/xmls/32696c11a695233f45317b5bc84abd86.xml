Lucknow: To eliminate hundreds of giant rodents that have dug tunnels under the platforms of the British-era Charbagh railway station, Railways have hired the “contract killers”. The rat-killing team will cover the circulating area, platforms, buildings and shunting yards and the cost will come to nearly Rs 40,000 a month. 
Senior Divisional Commercial Manager (Northern Railway – Lucknow) A K Sinha said “A private company has been given the contract for Rs 4.76 lakh to kill the rats, which have caused extensive damage to railway property, government files and passenger goods. The contract is for one year and work is likely to begin by this month-end.” The company will prepare edible items to kill rats and the ingredients of these will be according to World Health Organisation (WHO) norms. The rat menace on platforms and in office buildings has caused a huge loss of Rs 10 lakh to vendors in the past year, the official said, adding this has not only frightened them but also passengers. Rats have torn luggage bags in cloak rooms too.
