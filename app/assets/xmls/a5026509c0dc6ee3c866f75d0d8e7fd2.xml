Dubai&apos;s famous skyscraper has grabbed a starring role yet again in a new Hollywood venture directed by acclaimed film maker,‎ Terrence Malick. 
Nearly forty years in the making, the trailer of &apos;Voyage of Time: L‎ife&apos;s Journey&apos; has just dropped and this IMAX film finds screen time for the magnificence of Burj Khalifa in its two-minute run. 
The acclaimed director, who has films such as &apos;Badlands&apos;, &apos;Days of Heaven&apos; and &apos;The Thin Red Line&apos; to his credit, will have viewers embark on a journey from the birth of the universe to its very collapse. 
Two cuts of this film will be released in October of this year, with Hollywood actor Brad Pitt providing the narrative for the 40-minute version, while Oscar winner Cate Blanchett will feature on the 35mm 90-minute version. 
While more details of the film will surely unravel in the coming months, one can certainly hope to see more of Dubai on the Hollywood screen. Share with a friend or colleague Your e-mail address:
