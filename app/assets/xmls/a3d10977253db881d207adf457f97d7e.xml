Wildfire burns with ferocity never seen by fire crews By Associated Press | August 17, 2016 @ 8:47 pm 
Two women hug along Cajon Boulevard as a wildfire burns nearby in Devore, Calif., on Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2016. A wildfire with a ferocity never seen before by veteran California firefighters raced up and down canyons, instantly engulfing homes and forcing thousands of people to flee, some running for their lives just ahead of the flames. Authorities could not immediately say how many homes had been destroyed, but they warned that the number will be large (David Pardo/The Daily Press via AP)
