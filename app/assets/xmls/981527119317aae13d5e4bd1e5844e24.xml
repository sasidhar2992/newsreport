Rio Olympics draw to a close with Maracana Stadium spectacle Europe, Europa By our dpa-correspondent and Rio de Janeiro (dpa) - Brazil staged a showcase of its music and culture in Rio de Janeiro‘s iconic Maracana Stadium as the closing ceremony of the 2016 Olympics got underway on Sunday.Some 50,000 spectators braved the wind and pouring rain of the Brazil‘s tropical winter to see masses of dancers formed moving images of the Sugar Loaf Mountain and other famous sites of the host city, and to hear samba legend Martinho da Vila sing.The athletes who had competed for the Games‘ 2,102 gold, silver and bronze medals over the past two weeks were at the centre of the closing ceremony.US star gymnast Simone Biles was chosen to carry the flag for the US. Biles won four gold and one bronze medal at the Summer Games, helping to push her country to the top of Rio‘s medal table.The 207 national delegations also included a team of refugees for the first time in Olympic history - an initiative by the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to highlight the plight of the 65 million displaced people around the world.Canoer Isaquias Queiroz dos Santos, winner of two silver and one bronze medals, was to lead in the Brazilians as the last team.Having survived a kidnapping, severe burns and a serious accident as a child, Queiroz dos Santos exemplified the many athletes competing in Rio who have overcome great hardships on the road to the Olympic stage.Near the end of ceremony, the Olympic baton was to be symbolically handed over from Rio de Janeiro to Tokyo, which will host the next Games in 2020.The Rio Olympics, the first that were staged in South America, were to be formally closed by IOC president Thomas Bach.
