&quot;I just told them, &amp;apos;Look at the highest flag, and that&amp;apos;s what we did.&quot; -Carmelo Anthony, who led an inexperienced U.S. men&amp;apos;s basketball team to a gold medal at the Rio Summer Olympics, referring to the moment the team took to the podium and the spot where the American flag was about to rise.
&quot;This experience has been the dream of a lifetime for me,&quot; - U.S. gymnast and closing ceremony flagbearer Simone Biles, who won five medals, four of them gold, in her first Olympics.
&quot;The Hillary people want this to all be about tone and temperament. We also want to it be about facts and figures.&quot; -Donald Trump&amp;apos;s new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who insists the GOP presidential candidate is getting back on track after a stretch of gaffes and falling poll numbers.
