NEW Emotional Goodbye from Tragically Hip August 22, 2016 | 5:10 am Last Updated:August 22, 2016 | 5:31 am 
The Tragically Hip played what might be their last show with frontman Gord Downie Saturday night. 
People across the country tuned in to see the legendary Canadian singer give one of the most emotional and hard-hitting performances of his career. 
Downie was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in December and decided to go on what many expect to be the groups last tour together. 
In St. John&apos;s hundreds of people gathered on George Street to watch the event live and the sounds of the concert could be heard around the city. 
Damien Follett is a musician from St. John&apos;s who has been playing Hip songs since he started. 
He says the performance was an historical event for Canada. 
Follett says Downie is someone who gets lost in his songs, he gets up on stage and he wants to do it for the audience. 
He says the Hip are the ultimate Canadian band and the performance Saturday will leave more of a lasting impression than the band has already left on Canada.
