AskMe Permanent Closure Leaves Thousands of Workers Jobless 22nd, Aug 2016 11:35 AM View: 50 (2 ratings) 
AskMe , the Gurgaon-based company is finalizing its last move in the IT sector. The company is closing which will surely be a sip of poison for many employees working there. The step had been taken due to severe cash crunch. 
People can still find the website running but it has stopped taking further orders. Reports from some sources say that this closure is the result of an unplanned exit of its principal investor, Astro Holdings . After a prolonged battle from minority stakeholders, Malaysian business tycoon and CEO Astro Holdings Anand Krishnan led his company to get rid of the India-based firm. The Malaysian IT firm holds 97% stake shares in AskMe Group and made its last cash investment of 150 crores in the company last month. 
AskMe has recently made a legal step by writing a letter to Ministry of corporate affairs and Registrars of companies, asking them to endorse that the Malaysian firm should not leave without meeting its commitments and liabilities. 
Meanwhile, AskMe got more than 650 resignation applications from employees holding an annual salary package of 2.5 to 6 lakhs, which affected more than other 4000 employees, vendors, and other creditors. The company was delaying the salary of workers from past few months, and many of them have not gained any salary in August 2016. According to some leaks, this has been a result of non-payment issues with the Astro Holdings. AskMe has provided names and contact details of Astro management to the suffering workers to get any information regarding payment
