Close As kids return to school, police urge caution in school zones As kids go back to school this week, police are urging drivers to use extra caution in school zones.

NAMPA - It&apos;s the unofficial end of summer and the beginning of a new school year, and for kids in the West Ada and Nampa School Districts Sunday is the last day of summer vacation. With the start of a new school year comes more foot traffic in neighborhoods and school zones. 
Whether your child is walking or riding their bike to school there are things they should do make sure they stay safe. One example is something we all learn early on - looking both ways before crossing the street, and if you&apos;re riding a bike officials say to get off and walk your bike across the street. 
Nampa Police Sgt. Rob Wiggins says if you&apos;re driving through a school zone to be mindful of changing speed limits. He also says staying alert, especially during school hours, is key. 
&quot;We all know that sometimes kids don&apos;t necessarily pay attention in school zones, so we as drivers need to be extra careful just in case they decide to dart out in front of us and whatnot,&quot; said Wiggins. &quot;If you see kids that are going down the side of the road maybe give them a little more space than you would normally.&quot; 
Wiggins also says for those riding their bikes to and from school that they should be riding with traffic. Officials say school safety starts at home, and that children of all ages should know the rules of the road before that first day.
