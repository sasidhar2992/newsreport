Reuters reported that the US steel industry is considering challenging a trade deal with Russia that governs imports of hot-rolled steel, potentially reviving a decades old dispute amid mounting tensions over Russia’s actions in Ukraine.
Sources said that a so called suspension agreement struck after the Cold War has sheltered Russian steelmakers from steep anti-dumping duties on hot-rolled coil, instead setting a cap on HRC imports and a minimum price that many in the US industry believe is too low even after a 2012 revision.
An industry source familiar with the situation said that steel companies were looking at urging the US administration to drop or adjust those exemptions.
Imports of hot rolled, flat rolled, carbon-quality steel products from Russia rose 162% in the 3 months through April, compared with the previous three month period.
An attorney familiar with the Russian case said that “Given the volume of imports coming in, the industry is actively exploring its options to terminate or modify the agreement. We are in the process of preparing a filing for the US government.”
