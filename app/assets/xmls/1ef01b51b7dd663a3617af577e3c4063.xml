NEW Eastern Health Pulling Water Coolers from Facilities August 22, 2016 | 5:29 am 
Eastern Health has confirmed that it is in the process of removing water coolers from all of its sites, but water coolers remain for the time being at the Waterford Hospital. 
The health authority was responding to concerns raised by Opposition Health critic Steve Kent last week. 
Eastern Health says it began the process of reducing the number of bottled water coolers at each of its sites back in May as a cost-cutting measure. It says where managers felt that coolers were needed for patient comfort, a process was put in place that they would not be removed until a suitable alternative could be arranged. 
As a result, water coolers will remain on inpatient units at the Waterford until the assessment is complete. 
The health authority says if no alternative is found, then the coolers will remain indefinitely.
