The Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organisation (FETO), which Turkey blames for last month’s failed coup to topple President Tayyip Erdogan, has “infiltrated” India, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said. Asserting that FETO is “secretive transnational criminal network” with presence around the world, Cavusoglu said: “Unfortunately, FETO has also infiltrated India through associations and schools.” In an interview to PTI after holding talks with his Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj, the Turkish Foreign Minister said: “I have already taken up this issue with my counterpart.” The visiting minister said: “In all countries where FETO has a presence, we ask them to take immediate actions to remove them from their territories.” (Follow The Tribune on Facebook ; and Twitter @thetribunechd ) External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said the Indian side was “sensitive” to Turkish concerns and Indian security agencies were “looking into” Ankara’s demand for closure of associations connected with FETO which were carrying out illegal activities. Asserting that terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations constitute a threat to India and Turkey, Cavusoglu said: “Therefore, exchange of information regarding these threats and bilateral and multilateral cooperation and solidarity against terrorism is crucial.” “This is what both Turkey and India are focused on,” he said. On last month’s coup attempt, the Turkish minister said a clandestine faction led by FETO within the Turkish army attempted a coup to overthrow the democratically elected government. “We appreciate the prompt support to our democratically elected government by my Indian counterpart, External Affairs Minister Swaraj,” Cavusoglu added.
