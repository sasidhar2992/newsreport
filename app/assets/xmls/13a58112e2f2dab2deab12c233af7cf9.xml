About 150 people are gathered in the auditorium to hear wise words from a man dressed like a real-life transformer. 
His eyes glow red atop his cyber-age armour, a metal spike protruding from his forehead. He does not speak English; he needs an interpreter. Cosplay artist &apos;&apos;Goldy&apos;&apos; teaches students at RMIT Brunswick. Photo: Justin McManus 
Takahiro &quot;Goldy&quot; Sakai is like a rock star in the world of cosplay, a portmanteau of &quot;costume&quot; and &quot;play&quot;, which describes the art of dressing up as characters from anime, manga and video games. 
The originally small subculture has grown to a worldwide multimillion-dollar industry for millions of fans, who participate in international conventions and competitions such as Oz Comic-Con in Melbourne . Takahiro &quot;Goldy&quot; Sakai. Photo: Brook Mitchell 
Goldy has been making cosplay outfits for 20 years, and it can take him up to seven months to finish one. He typically uses light &quot;firm foams&quot; and silver-coloured vinyl sheets to make them more comfortable to wear but even so, he can lose about three kilograms from sweating inside. 
The &quot;mecha&quot; (robot anime) costumes are based on shows such as Gundam and Evangelion . The most important step is in the planning. Advertisement 
&quot;First of all, you have to have a very clear image of the thing you want to create,&quot; Goldy says. &quot;Once that&apos;s done, then you need to make paper patterns, like when you make a dress.&quot; 
The most difficult thing, he says, is trying to recreate the often &quot;atypical&quot; shape of these fictional characters, which may have &quot;a very narrow waist or very huge height&quot;. Goldy takes a ride with cosplay fans in Melbourne. Photo: Justin McManus 
Goldy visited Melbourne on Monday as part of the Tokyo government&apos;s move to promote understanding of Japanese culture. 
Crowds gathered at his free public lecture at RMIT&apos;s Brunswick campus, and an exclusive workshop with 22 students was sold out within half an hour. 
So passionate about cosplay is Goldy that he wore his costume throughout both events, removing his helmet only briefly to have some orange juice and sushi while networking. 
In Japan, Goldy teaches cosplay workshops in Tokyo and judges international competitions. 
The appeal of cosplay for him is not about losing oneself as much as talking to other people and fostering cultural exchange. 
&quot;I don&apos;t tend to become a character when I put on a costume,&quot; he says. &quot;I see cosplay as a means of communication. As far as I am concerned it&apos;s just a great way to meet and make friends with people.&quot;
