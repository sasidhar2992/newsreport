No furnaces required! Iron, gold and food drop their cooked variety. 
Other Information 

Border starts to shrink to 300x300 2 minutes after meetup has been called. Being outside will make it damage you until it eventually kills you. Once the border has reached 300x300 it will shrink to 200x200 and then shrink to the final size 100x100 . 
We usually have our arena enabled when the game opens. Type /a in-game to join the Arena! 
Remember to read /UHC in-game for additional information on rules and game information. 
You can always bring this post up later by typing /post in-game. 
Final heal is 20 seconds after the start of the game.
