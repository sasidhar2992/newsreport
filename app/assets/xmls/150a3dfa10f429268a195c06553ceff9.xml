Official: 6 officers hurt by inmates at Illinois prison By Associated Press | August 21, 2016 @ 9:50 pm Tweet 
PONTIAC, Ill. (AP) — An Illinois Department of Corrections spokeswoman says six officers have been injured by inmates at a maximum-security prison. 
IDOC spokeswoman Nicole Wilson said in a brief statement that the correctional officers were treated for injuries that are not life-threatening after the incident Sunday at the Pontiac Correctional Center. 
Wilson says the officers were hurt in “an assault involving five offenders.” Wilson didn’t respond to questions about what type of injuries the officers suffered or what led to the incident. Her statement says the IDOC is investigating and cannot release any further details.
