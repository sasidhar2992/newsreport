Proskauer Continues Expansion of Global Finance Practice with Addition of Ben Davis in London 
International law firm Proskauer has announced today the arrival of Ben Davis as a partner in the Firm&apos;s Finance practice in London. 
Mr. Davis&apos; primary expertise is within the leveraged finance market where he regularly advises on acquisition and leveraged finance facilities, corporate facilities and debt restructurings. 
&quot;Alternative lenders in the UK, and globally, require sophisticated legal counsel who truly understand their business objectives and can provide market insight on both sides of the pond. We have successfully, and uniquely, built a deep bench of lawyers with this expertise and we are delighted to have Ben join us to further strengthen the team,&quot; said Steven Ellis, co-head of the Multi-Tranche Finance Group. 
Focusing on both the mid-market and upper market, Mr. Davis has clients including alternative lenders, private equity sponsors, and other financial entities. He has broad experience advising on unitranche loans, second lien facilities, mezzanine and high-yield bonds, as well as real estate finance and litigation funding. His arrival is the latest addition to Proskauer&apos;s strategic growth in the alternative lending and leveraged finance arenas. Recent high-profile hires in the past year include Kristen Campana in New York, Sandra Montgomery in Los Angeles, and Alexander Griffith in London. His arrival to the London office also follows the recent additions of private equity real estate partners Jo Owen and Vikki McKay. 
&quot;Ben&apos;s experience in leveraged finance matters fits perfectly within our corporate platform in London and globally, where we continue to serve asset managers in their most significant matters,&quot; said Mary Kuusisto, head of the London office. 
Mr. Davis received his undergraduate economics degree with honors from Durham University and his graduate degree from Nottingham Law School. He joins the Firm from Reed Smith.
