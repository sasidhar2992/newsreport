37 Descripción del Proyecto 
I need an iPhone/iPad app. I would like it designed and built. I need to have an app built. Basically it is an app that allows people to go on and find advice about what ever they are looking for in different categories. They need to be able to log on with facebook or have an account. They also need to be able to create a thread for the advice and have an option to post annonomously. I will need it to be for both apple and Android. Thanks
