LONDON ( Alliance News ) - AIM-listed cash shell Yujin International Ltd on Monday said it is has agreed to acquire Healthperm Resourcing Ltd and will cancel its listing on AIM to move to the ISDX market in London .

Yujin , which has previously been in the business of chartering tanker fleets in Asia-Pacific before converting to a cash shell earlier this year, said it will acquire Healthperm for GBP11.2 million in shares. Healthperm has been founded to recruit nurses from the Philippines in order to plug gaps in permanent nurses in the healthcare systems in the UK and the United Arab Emirates .

To facilitate the deal, Yujin said it will cancel its listing on AIM and instead seek to be admitted to the ISDX Growth Market, which it said is a &quot;more appropriate market given the relatively early stage of development of the Healthperm business&quot;.

Yujin is also undertaking a share consolidation, which will involve raising GBP275,000 via a share issue at 150.00 pence per share, and will change its name to Healthperm Resourcing Ltd. 

The plans will be put to Yujin shareholders at a meeting on September 15 , with its shares expected to be cancelled from AIM on September 23 . Shares in Yujin were suspended from trading on AIM on Monday morning.
