Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy said it would not oppose China’s home appliance maker Midea from acquiring German robot maker Kuka, as the deal would not endanger Germany’s security. Midea said on August 8 that it held a 94.55% stake in Kuka. To allay concerns over the take-over, Midea has pledged to maintain Kuka’s independence and has no plans to delist the company.
