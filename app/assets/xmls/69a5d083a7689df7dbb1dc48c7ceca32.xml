We all know the frustration of playing a long tournament only to bust out just before the money. We also all know how having a big stack in the deep stages of a tournament is the best feeling ever. 
PokerStars have just released a new format which is designed to accommodate these two experiences - Bubble Rush tournaments. 
Basically the blinds go up incredibly fast at the start (Think hyper turbo speed) with the intention of getting everyone to the money within the first hour . After the bubble bursts the event slows down to regular speed so you can enjoying playing deep poker on your way to the final table. 
Clearly it is a format which suits both recreational players and professionals alike, both of whom don&apos;t particularly want to play all night and the miss the money, and all of whom would prefer to play deep when the decisions really make a difference. 
Over 20 tournaments a day are running right now in the PokerStars lobby with buy-ins from $0.55 to $109 . There are also Bubble Rush Challenges in the PokerStars client this week.
