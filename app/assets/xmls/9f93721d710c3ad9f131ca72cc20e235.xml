Quick Thai pineapple fried rice 22 August, 2016 By Tara Mathews Leave a Comment 
On my recent visit to Thailand , one of the dishes I really enjoyed was a hearty serve of fried rice. Sometimes it was made quite simply with just a few ingredients and other times it was loaded with fresh vegetables. A photo posted by vegeTARAian – Tara Mathews (@vegetaraian) on Aug 5, 2016 at 8:01pm PDT On my travels I went three cooking classes in different parts of the country, learning how to make veg versions of popular Thai dishes. Since coming home, I’ve been playing in the kitchen to perfect my own fried rice recipe. The tasty result has me thinking I was back in Thailand. Almost. I like the addition of pineapple which gives the dish a sweet and savoury combo, and including goodies like toasted cashews and fried shallots also adds a lovely crunch. This is basically a mammoth serve of vegies with rice – what’s not to love about that? Tip: Get creative and add your favourite veg! It cooks very quickly so the trick is to be completely prepared beforehand – make sure all your vegetables are chopped and ready to go before you turn the heat on. You’ll spend more time chopping than you will cooking! 5 from 1 reviews Quick Thai pineapple fried rice
