Photo: Supplied CHAIR WOMAN For a statement piece, look no further than Up5_6, designed by Gaetano Pesce in the late ’60s for the Up Series 2000. Representing the female form tied to a ball-shaped ottoman – to highlight the shackles that keep women subjugated – it’s at once playful and luxe. B&amp;B Italia Up Series 2000 Up5_6, from $8935 

WISH UPON A STAR Featuring a brilliant-cut diamond (D colour) surrounded by six rare natural pink Argyle diamonds of 3P colour, this ring is the star of the Michael Wilson gallery. Handcrafted in platinum. D Flawless and Rare Pink Diamond Star, $14,900
