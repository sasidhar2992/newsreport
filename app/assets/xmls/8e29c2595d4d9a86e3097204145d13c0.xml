WASHINGTON (AP) - Marcelo Sarvas and Patrick Mullins scored three minutes apart in the second half and D.C. United rallied for a 2-2 draw with the New York City Red Bulls on Sunday in a game delayed 75 minutes because of lightning. 
Sarvas scored his first goal on a penalty kick in the 70th minute and Mullins got his first with a header off a corner kick in the 73rd as D.C. United (6-8-10) moved ahead of Orlando City on the red line in the Eastern Conference. Both teams have 28 points, but D.C. holds the tiebreaker for the sixth spot. 
The comeback was unexpected for the lowest scoring team in the MLS, especially after the Red Bulls (10-9-7), third in the East, took the lead on the soggy field. The delay came in the ninth minute. 
Bradley Wright-Phillips, in the 38th minute, knocked in the perfect serve from Mike Grella. Wright-Phillips became the fourth player in league history to reach 15 goals in three consecutive seasons. Then in the 64th minute Felipe notched his third, pounding the ball into a small opening just inside the post.
