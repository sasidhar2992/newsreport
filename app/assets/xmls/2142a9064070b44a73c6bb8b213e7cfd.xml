Neighbors and friends react to violent overnight shooting at hou - WFSB 3 Connecticut Member Center: Neighbors and friends react to violent overnight shooting at house party Posted: (WFSB) BRIDGEPORT, CT (WFSB) - 
A friend who planned to be in attendance of the house party where 13 people were injured following a shooting never expected a situation like this to unfold. 
Eyewitness News spoke with a man who decided to go home instead of attending a late night house party on Plymouth Street. 
&quot;This is a party we do every year,” said Bridgeport resident, Jonathon Robles, &quot;After the movie, I told my cousin, ‘Hey, let&apos;s go for a little bit,’” said Robles. 
&quot;Then my cousin said, ‘I&apos;m tired no let’s go. We can see him tomorrow.’&quot; 
Police said in a press conference that two suspects, who opened fire on a party with over a hundred people, remain at large. 
Twelve of the 13 victims struck by bullets at the party remain in stable condition at Yale New Haven Hospital. One woman remains in critical condition with a gunshot wound to her upper lip. 
Neighbors told Eyewitness News that they were alerted to shots, and people fleeing the area. 
&quot;When I saw all the yelling and the screaming,” said Bridgeport Aiesha Turpin. “That&apos;s when I noticed that something was going on.&quot; 
Detectives will be canvassing the area looking for videos, photos, or any instances of tracing the suspects. Neighbors said they are still reeling from the incident. 
&quot;I wouldn&apos;t think anything like that would happen here,&quot; said Turpin. &quot;It&apos;s a pretty quiet street.&quot; Copyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved. Most Popular Stories Most Popular Stories More&gt;&gt;
