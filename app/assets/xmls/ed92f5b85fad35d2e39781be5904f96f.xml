Simone Biles admirably carries flag twice her size Nate Scott, USA TODAY Sports , KING 6:19     
RIO DE JANEIRO — When Team USA asked gymnastics star Simone Biles to be the flag bearer for the team during the Closing Ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics, it may have overlooked a simple matter of logistics — the flag is extremely large … and Biles isn’t. 
One of the more striking images of these Olympics will have to be the 4-foot-9 Biles holding the massive flag of her country as her Team USA teammates paraded into Maracana Stadium. 
Strength, of course, can’t be considered an issue. Biles may be 4-9, but her strength could rival any of the athletes here at the Olympics. She won five medals this Olympics, four golds and a bronze, in the process redefining what many believed possible in the sport of gymnastics. 
As an undeniable breakout star these games, Biles was an easy choice for the Americans. The flag bearer for the opening ceremony, Michael Phelps, had already returned to the United States. — NBC Olympics (@NBCOlympics) August 22, 2016 #TeamUSA flag bearer.. nbd.
