The battle for control of China Vanke, China’s largest home builder, heated up after the country’s No 2 player – China Evergrande Group – raised its stake in China Vanke to nearly 7%. Vanke is already fending off a potential bid from its biggest investor Baoneng Group, which has built up a 25% stake despite opposition from Vanke’s Board and management. Evergrande said it had paid CNY5.46 billion for another 2.14% stake in Vanke, becoming its No 3 investor. The stake increase came nearly two weeks after Evergrande surprised investors by buying 4.68% of Vanke for CNY9.1 billion. Officials at Vanke, worth about USD40 billion by market value, declined to comment on Evergrande’s latest move. Evergrande, which has a market capitalization of about USD10 billion and had total long-term debt twice that amount as of end-2015, declined to comment on whether it might increase its holding or seek representation on Vanke’s Board. “Evergrande will buy more; from its track record it wouldn’t stop at a 6%-plus stake,” said UOB Kay Hian Analyst David Yang in Shanghai. He expected Evergrande to seek seats on Vanke’s Board at the latter’s next annual shareholder meeting in March 2017. Wang Shi, Vanke’s Chairman, has publicly opposed Baoneng’s moves in the past, urging regulators to investigate the funding of its purchases of Vanke shares.
