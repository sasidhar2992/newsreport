NEW RCMP Warn Northern Peninsula to Keep Their Moose Eyes On August 22, 2016 | 5:20 am 
The RCMP are warning drivers on the Northern Peninsula to be especially wary of moose in the region. 
Over the past several weeks, Port Saunders and Flowers Cove RCMP have responded to a number of moose-vehicle collisions and have received numerous reports of &quot;near misses.&quot; 
During the summer months, there is a higher number of tourists in the area, and therefore higher than normal traffic volume. Motorists are reminded to keep a safe distance between themselves and the vehicle ahead of them, allowing precious time to be able to stop quickly to avoid a moose. 
Moose are more likely to be along the side of the road between dusk and dawn. 
Drivers can greatly reduce the risk of moose-involved collisions by reducing speeds to below posted limits, particularly at night. Drivers should also ensure their headlights are in good working order and that they pay extra attention to the edges of the roadways.
