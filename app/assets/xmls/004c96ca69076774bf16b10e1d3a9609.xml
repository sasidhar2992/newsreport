Well, Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County: ACTBACT NC has in its wisdom decided that their placement of so-called Confederate flags on private property along I-40 / 85 is a great way to declare to folks passing through that they are in Dogpatch, USA, a backwater of ignorance, prejudice and hatred. I have to conclude that these people want to take back their county/state from blacks, against whom they present a firm dislike, disguised in quasi-religious terms and patriotic clap-trap. 
Of course since there is no real news here in Dogpatch, the newspapers cover people like this who should be firmly ignored and shunned. There may be hope that the folks here in Alamance-Dogpatch are improving, but then I watch and wonder, for some 35 years now. Could it be DNA or are those transiting our fair burg at risk to catch a bug infects white people with unfortunate results?
