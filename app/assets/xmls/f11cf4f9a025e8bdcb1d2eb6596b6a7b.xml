Malian extremist to go on trial for Timbuktu rampage By AP - 22 August 2016 @ 3:32 PM 
THE HAGUE: An Islamic radical accused of destroying historic mausoleums in the Malian desert city of Timbuktu is going on trial at the International Criminal Court. 
Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi has said he plans to plead guilty Monday morning to allegations that he was personally involved in the destruction when he was a member of Ansar Dine, an Islamic extremist group with links to al-Qaida that held power in northern Mali in 2012. 
The radicals destroyed 14 of Timbuktu’s 16 mausoleums because they considered them totems of idolatry. The one-room structures that house the tombs of the city’s great thinkers were on the World Heritage list. 
Al Mahdi is the first suspect to face an ICC charge of deliberately attacking religious or historical monuments. --AP 8 reads (FILES) This file photo taken on September 30, 2015 shows alleged Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist leader Ahmad Faqi Al Mahdi (L) looking on in the courtroom of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.An unprecedented case opens on August 22, 2016 at the International Criminal Court when an alleged Malian jihadist is set to plead guilty to the war crime of destroying the UNESCO world heritage site of Timbuktu. And experts hope the trial and sentencing of Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi for the 2012 attacks on Timbuktu will send a message that such cultural destruction will not go unpunished. / AFP Photo / ANP Related stories
