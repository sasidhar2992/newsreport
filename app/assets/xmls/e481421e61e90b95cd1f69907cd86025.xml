About the Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion Systems Market Autotransfusion involves the collection of blood before surgeries and its transfusion during cardiac operations. This procedure is processed in autotransfusion systems that help minimize blood loss by collecting and filtering the RBCs, and reinfusing the blood into an individual.Autotransfusion is an autologous technology involving the retransfusion of a person&apos;s own blood, which increases the need for traditional centrifuge devices for separating the RBCs from the blood. Advances in technology have led companies to integrate ultrafiltration technique for blood collection. For instance, Advancis Surgical&apos;s ultrafiltration-based HemoSep system can improve patient recovery time by filtering inflammatory molecules, preserving normal clotting function, and maintaining platelet populations.

Covered in this report The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global cardiopulmonary autotransfusion systems for 2016-2020. To calculate the market size, Technavio considers the revenue generated from the total consumption of cardiopulmonary autotransfusion systems globally. These systems help reduce the risk of infections that can occur due to the use of allogenic blood. The market is divided into the following segments based on geography: Americas
