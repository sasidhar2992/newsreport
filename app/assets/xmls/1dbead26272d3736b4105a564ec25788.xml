Home Opponents: Memphis, Sacramento, Minnesota, New Orleans Road Destinations: Clippers, San Antonio, Golden State 
Key Matchups April 9 vs. Minnesota (6:30 p.m. PT; Time Warner Cable SportsNet) The final meeting between two of the NBA’s most promising young cores will also double as the Lakers’ penultimate home game. The Lakers and Timberwolves will meet four times this season, but this one will see how both have progressed with an added season of experience. Some of the most promising young guns will duel as D’Angelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram take on Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Zach LaVine and Kris Dunn. April 11 vs. New Orleans (7:30 p.m. PT; Time Warner Cable SportsNet) Barring a postseason appearance, Lakers fans will get their last chance to pack Staples Center this season for this meeting with the Pelicans. While Ingram might be wrapping up his case for Rookie of the Year, New Orleans will have another candidate, Buddy Hield, who has been brought in to help Anthony Davis provide the offensive firepower. April 12 at Golden State (7:30 p.m. PT; Time Warner Cable SportsNet) Almost poetically, Luke Walton’s season as head coach of the Lakers will conclude against the team that he just left. With Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson in charge, Golden State will have a championship in sight, while the purple and gold hope to disrupt any momentum they can in front of the Oracle Arena fans.
