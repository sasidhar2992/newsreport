Malcolm Garrett: Purple 
A new exhibition, titled Purple , is bringing together over 30 artists to celebrate the life and work of Prince, the musician who died this year aged 57. Each artwork is being printed in purple ink onto lavender GF Smith colorplan paper on the Risograph machine at Fred Aldous in Manchester, where the exhibition will take place. 
Organised by designer Robert Lomas the artists and studios taking part in the exhibition include illustrators Craig &amp; Karl, designer Malcolm Garrett, Barcelona’s Hey Studio, as well as local talent such as illustrator Stan Chow, DR.ME and digital studio Design By Day. 
Another recent addition to the artist line up is Martin Homent who was Prince’s official art director and worked with him on many projects including artwork for the albums HITnRUN Phase One and Phase Two . 
The exhibition will run for three weeks from 5 September at Fred Aldous in Manchester. Artworks will be available to buy online with all proceeds going to the local Manchester charity Back On Track which enables disadvantaged adults to make positive changes to their lives.
