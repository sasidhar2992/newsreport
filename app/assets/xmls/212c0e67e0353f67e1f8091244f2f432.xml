Pole vaulter Eliza McCartney reunites with mentor Sarah Walker 
Monday 22 Aug 2016 7:39 p.m. 
It&apos;s been a fantastic Olympics for New Zealand. There has been plenty of controversy but for the Kiwis, it has been a record-setting result - four gold, nine silver and five bronze medals. 
One of those bronze medals went to Eliza McCartney who is now the second-youngest New Zealand medallist. 
She credits part of her success to mentor and BMX rider Sarah Walker. 
McCartney had Walker on speed dial for moral support at the Olympics but Walker received a surprise phone call herself. 
She had been hand-picked by the IOC president to join the committee. 
Story caught up with the two athletes in Rio.
