EF 16-35mm f/2.8L IS III &amp; EF 24-105mm f/4L IS II USD Pricing By Canon Rumors | August 22, 2016 
Pricing for all of the new Canon gear should be leaking out this week ahead of the August 25, 2016 launch day. 
The following are the prices floating around in USD for the new Canon lenses. Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L III $2199 Shipping will start in October Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS II $1099 Kits should ship fairly soon after launch, retail version unknown. 
We haven’t yet received a confirmed price in the United States on the EOS 5D Mark IV, but we think it’ll be between $3299-$3499 USD. 
We’ve heard from one country that the ship date for the EOS 5D Mark IV would be September 9, 2016, but we haven’t been able to confirm that anywhere else.
