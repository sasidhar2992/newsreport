National Under-23 team coach Samson Siasia and his captain Mikel Obi have hailed the bronze medal won by the team at the Rio 2016 Olympics on Saturday. 
Nigeria defeated Honduras 3-2 to get their only medal at the Games. 
Siasia told the media, “I want to say thanks to the players. They did a great job. It is good to take something back home. 
“Having bronze is not easy; we are happy and we have to celebrate. We have to enjoy this moment.” 
Mikel praised the effort of his coach, saying it was painful to lose 2-0 to Germany in the semifinals. 
The Chelsea midfielder said, “It is very important (bronze), because football in Nigeria is absolutely massive. We had extra-pressure perhaps, but we have done it for us, for our family, for Nigeria. 
“I was disappointed against Germany because I don’t like losing, I always want to win. But I am so proud of this team, the boys. They worked so hard. 
“We have an amazing coach; he’s always been there for the boys.” 
Honduras coach Jorge Pint said, “We are satisfied but not happy. Not happy because we think that could take another thing out from Rio 2016 (a medal). But the experience is good and Honduras will understand that the players have made very important things.” 
He added, “I am happy, we did a good job, it was an extraordinary experience in Brazil. We are among the four best teams in the world and that is important for Honduras, a country where life is football.” 
It is the third Olympic men’s football medal for Nigeria. The Under-23 team won gold at the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games and silver at Beijing 2008.
