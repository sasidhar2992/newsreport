Photo: Emsie Martin GEORGE NEWS - The recent fire in the open veld in Davidson Road opposite the George Hospital exposed a number of informal dwellings but they were removed very soon after, following complaints by residents of the nearby Heatherlands neighbourhood. According to George Municipality Acting Communications Manager Chantel Edwards-Klose, the municipality demolished the structures. &quot;The land is the property of the provincial government. Our land management team did, however, remove all the dwellings on Tuesday 16 August.&quot; She said the people were not relocated. &quot;Everyone who genuinely needs accommodation is referred to the Housing Department&apos;s offices and they are assisted in accordance with the applicable policies,&quot; said Edwards-Klose.
