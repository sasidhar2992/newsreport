Pep Guardiola opens up about Joe Hart’s Man City future 
Hart, 29, has been left out in the cold by new boss Pep Guardiola. 
He has been on the bench for City&apos;s three games in the Premier League and Champions League this season, with Willy Caballero being preferred. 
And the Telegraph report Everton have made an offer to the England keeper, either to take him on loan or permanently. 
The Toffees have already signed a goalkeeper this summer, with former Holland international Maarten Stekelenburg joining the club. 
Despite his good form in the first two games of the season, he was signed as back-up and Ronald Koeman wants Hart as his No.1. 
Everton face competition for Hart&apos;s services, with Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund looking for a long-term replacement for Roman Weidenfeller. 
GETTY BENCHED: Hart hasn&apos;t played a minute this season 
The Telegraph claim Hart&apos;s asking price is likely to be above £20m. 
City are close to bringing in a replacement for Hart, with Barcelona keeper Claudio Bravo likely to join after the two clubs agreed a fee. 
City will pay up to £17m for the Chilean. Related articles
