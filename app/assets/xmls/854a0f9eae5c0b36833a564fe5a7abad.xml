The list represents the most comprehensive look at the most important segment of the economy—America’s independent entrepreneurs.

“We’re thrilled that what started in a spare bedroom after Hurricane Katrina has now grown into one of America’s fastest-growing private companies. We love that we are based in New Orleans and are proud that Search Influence now employs almost 80 of the area’s best and brightest,” said Will Scott, CEO and co-founder of Search Influence.
