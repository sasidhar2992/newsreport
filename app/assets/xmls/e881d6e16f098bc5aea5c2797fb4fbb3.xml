Print This Bishop Daniel Obinim An Aide to the embattled Preacher, Bishop Daniel Obinim, says the man of God is ready to honour an invitation to him by the Tema police. Joseph Osei Brenya says his boss has been unable to honour the police invitation because he is out of town. “He is a law abiding citizen. He has stated many times on radio that he respects Ghana police service, he respects the judicial system, he respects the institutions of government and if any invitation is extended to him he will humbly go,” Mr Brenya told Joy News. Police issued a 24-hour ultimatum to the controversial pastor on Sunday after he failed to honour an earlier invitation. Bishop Obinim is facing arrest after he publicly lashed two young adults in his church. He was widely condemned after a video showing him whipping the two for fornicating surfaced. The Bishop removed his belt, whipped the young man and his girlfriend, both of whom are said to be his adopted children and later invited one of his right-hand men to join in the whipping, on Wednesday, August 17. Police say if they will be forced to take drastic action if the Bishop fails to show up. However, Mr Brenya told Joy News it will come to that. “The [police invite] came on Friday in the evening. The Tema Resident Pastor brought it, but even at that time he hadn’t met Bishop so as I speak to you, I can’t confirm whether he had handed the letter to Bishop. Currently he is in Kumasi having a church service,” he explained. The Gender Ministry lodged a formal complaint at the Domiestic Violence and Victim&apos;s Support Unit (DOVVSU) of the Ghana Police Service following the viral video. The Ministry believes the rights of the two, a 14-year-old girl and her 16-year-old boyfriend, were abused when they were flogged in front of hundreds of church members for having unprotected sex.
