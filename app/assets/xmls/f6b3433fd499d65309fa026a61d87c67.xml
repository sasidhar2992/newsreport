Print This Late Samuel Nuamah The presidential press corps on Sunday, 21 August attended a ceremony commemorating the one-year anniversary of the passing of Ghanaian Times reporter, Samuel Nuamah. The journalist died on 20 August last year when the presidential press corps was involved in an accident. They were returning from official duty in the Volta regional capital when the accident happened. He was survived by a wife and a child. Relatives, friends, and members of the presidential press corps massed up at the Evangelical Baptist Mission church at Teshie, a suburb of Accra, to mark the first anniversary. Prayers were said for the family of the deceased. The mother of the deceased, Georgina Opoku, said: “He was the bread winner of the family. Things have not been the same since his passing. The incident is still fresh on my mind.” Mr Emmanuel Asamoah, another relative, said: “If Sammy were alive…I know he would come around and share jokes with us.”
