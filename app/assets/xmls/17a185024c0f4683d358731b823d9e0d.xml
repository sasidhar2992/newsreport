The bomber — believed be a teenager — detonated his explosives as officials were handing out trophies to players after the tournament, killing 29 and wounding 60.
Isis claimed responsibility and released a photo of the attacker in which he appears to be no more than 16 years old.
Nearly half of those killed were also children, participating in the game or cheering from the stands.
Fatalities from Terrorist Attacks in Turkey | FindTheData The UN&apos;s children&apos;s agency, UNICEF, said in a recent report that thousands of children have been abducted in Iraq.
Girls, the group says, are at greatest risk of being sold into sexual slavery while boys are often forced into becoming combatants or suicide bombers.
