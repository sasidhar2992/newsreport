Taking place at Dartmouth House in the heart of London’s prestigious Mayfair, this event will host foreign investors who are attracted by the continent’s startling economic and demographic growth prospects and investigating opportunities in African real estate markets. This forum provides a platform for investors, lenders and developers to hear the latest insights on the key challenges and opportunities in West African real estate.
