I swore out a warrant on a man on June 27 for assaulting me for doing my job at a convenience store. The court date was supposed to be Aug. 12. I was the only one to show. I was told the warrant was never served after six weeks. Why couldn&apos;t I be notified so I wouldn&apos;t have to drive to Graham on borrowed gas money. I even called on Aug. 11 to inquire as to the building location and was told the Annex. Afer I had parked and gone in, I was told the new building, so I had to hobble down there. 
So today I&apos;m sending several letters. I may not be the smartest, fastest or richest, but I am very tired of being treated badly. I am ex-manager of the convenience store. As such, I was trained on the local level and then in 2012 on the state level. Our company policy says that no employee may play the lottery. The state requires that the lottery be played by people over 18 years of age. Our register requires an actual birthday. No birth date, no purchase. Therefore I cannot enter mine instead. Anyone under 40 I am supposed to card. Anyone over 40, I ask. The defendant decided to smack me in the face for asking his birth date, after I returned his money. 
I take my job fairly seriously. If I sell underage, I get a criminal record. At 64, I don&apos;t need that. 
May I suggest that other people that have much more serious positions take their jobs more seriously.
