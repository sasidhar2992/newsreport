Verdura and Belperron COO Departs   
Sounds like they are more glad that she finally quit. 
I hope our industry finds good fresh leaders with new realistic ideas and truly intelligent &amp; creative mindset and stop recycling the old ones that have been a complete failure. Only good and successful experience should count. Time for a positive change leading to a better future. Link:
