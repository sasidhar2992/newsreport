My maxed out lynx is useless My maxed out lynx is useless by footyhead1974 Float this Topic to the Top Bookmark ★★★★ Novice ‎08-21-2016 11:44 PM My maxed out lynx is just no match these days. I cant understand how another lynx with no decals can wipe me out alot quicker than i can load my third shot( thats using scope as well). Do different regions around the world have different specs on thier tanks.not to mention all the beefed up t5s and t6s out there. I cant save enough cash or diamonds cause i keep getting smashed. It is really getting frustrating, im sure there are lots out there feeling this pain. Match ups are really getting worse. I even tried using bait tanks and even with a tier 1 im getting matched with t5/6s. How is the normal user suppost to make progress without a hack or pooring loads of cash into it which is what the developers want.IF THE DEVELOPERS READ THIS FIX THIS PROBLEM.
