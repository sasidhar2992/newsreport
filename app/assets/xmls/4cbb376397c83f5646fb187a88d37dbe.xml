He is respected as he has good understanding of the economy and the policy mechanism as he proposed the inflation targeting and also the monetary policy committee. If past is any indication the RBI governors have hardly pleased their political masters is clear in the way the last 3 governors are given a send off. Can he bite the bullet of correctness in policy will be interesting.
