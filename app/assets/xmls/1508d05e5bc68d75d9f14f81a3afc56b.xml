20 years later, police may have answers in Trudy Appleby disapearance 
By Sarah Greene | 
Updated 08/21 2016 10:54PM EAST MOLINE, Ill. It&apos;s been two decades since 11-year-old, Trudy Appleby, went missing in Moline. Every year, Trudy&apos;s family holds a remembrance vigil in her honor. But this year, things were different. Detectives told the crowd they believe they know who is responsible for Trudy&apos;s disappearance. They just need people to speak up. The Moline Detective on the case, Michael Griffin said, &quot;We would ask those people who know what happened to Trudy that day to come forward and tell us and let&apos;s end this nightmare for Trudy&apos;s family. &quot; Police did say the person they think is responsible for Trudy&apos;s disappearance has died, but all they need to close the case are the people related to the suspect to tell a 20 year old family secret. If they can get that last piece of the puzzle, Trudy&apos;s loved ones can finally get the closure they&apos;ve been looking for for 20 years. Trudy&apos;s Father, Dennis Appleby said, &quot;I need that, I mean the whole community needs it. You just don&apos;t have an 11-year-old girl drop out of existence as this one appears to have done, and we know that that&apos;s not the case.&quot; Trudy&apos;s father said, he wants the question he&apos;s been asking for two decades answered. He asked, &quot;Why did you do it? Why has it taken 20 years to say anything? Why, why is it that you think you feel it&apos;s right that you get to take and enjoy your life? You get to take and have the things that Trudy didn&apos;t, where&apos;s that fair?&quot; While the hope of finding Trudy alive gets smaller as the years pass, the family still has hope their suffering will come to an end. &quot;The only hope I have is that this gets corrected[..] the only hope I have is that this is done,&quot; said Dennis Appleby.
