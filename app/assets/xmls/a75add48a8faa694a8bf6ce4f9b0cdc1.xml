A murder hunt is today underway a mother was found dead at the home she shared with her three young children. 
Friends and neighbours wept as they laid flowers and cards outside the house of 42-year-old Debbie Wilkinson. 
Mrs Wilkinson, a self-employed hairdresser, was also married and her oldest child was only 14 - although it is believed that she and her husband were separated.

She was thought to currently be living in the property alone with her children. 
A post-mortem examination revealed she had died from a head injury. 
A 73-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering Mrs Wilkinson and released on bail pending further inquiries. 
Last night the children were being cared for by relatives as a painstaking forensic examination of the semi-detached house continued. 
It is understood Mrs Wilkinson may have been dead for 24 hours before her body was found in the home on the modern housing development in Hemlington, a suburb of Middlesbrough, around 7pm on Friday. 
Neighbours who had been out for the evening returned to find the cul-de-sac cordoned off and full of police cars. 
A neighbour, who knew the woman, said: &apos;I saw two ambulances at the house on Friday night. 
&apos;I went out and when I got back later on there were police everywhere.&apos;

The neighbour said she had lived there for several years, aside from a period when she moved out and the house was rented out. 
&apos;She was a nice lass, she would always say hello.&apos; 
One man, who did not want to be name, said he did not see anything suspicious that night but said he had recently seen a &apos;scruffy-looking&apos; man on the street several times. 
Another neighbour said: &apos;It&apos;s awful for something like that to happen around here.&apos; 
Mrs Wilkinson had moved into the house around the time of the birth of her first child, neighbours said. She was a lovely woman 
A member of Mrs Wilkinson&apos;s family said yesterday: &apos;All we know is a friend of hers was arrested. He had gone to see her 24 hours before she was found unresponsive. 
&apos;We are still in the dark about what happened. All we can say is she lived for three things – for her flowers, for her hair and for her children. The children are staying with family and are fine.&apos; A neighbour said: &apos;It is so sad and shocking. She was a lovely woman and so quiet. This is normally such a peaceful area.&apos; 
Yesterday friends arrived to pay floral tributes to the mother. 
One group of women who said they had gone to school with Mrs Wilkinson sobbed as they clung to each other. 
One card read: &apos;Our Bexley babe. Can&apos;t believe you are not here. I hold precious memories of our friendship. You are now in heaven with your dad who will take care of you.&apos; 
Another person wrote: &apos;We have cut fresh flowers from our garden for you and hope you are in God&apos;s beautiful garden and are at peace.&apos; One tribute read: &apos;Memories of you fill my mind like thousands of stars.&apos; 
One card featured a child&apos;s drawing of a flower with the message: &apos;Debbie – because you loved flowers.&apos; 
A spokesman for Cleveland Police said: &apos;Detectives are working to establish the events surrounding the woman&apos;s death, but at this stage the death is being treated as suspicious. 
&apos;Post-mortem results show that the woman died as a result of a head injury.&apos; The spokesman added that &apos;support is being provided to the woman&apos;s family&apos;. Most watched News videos
