China’s non-financial outbound direct investment (ODI) soared to CNY673.24 billion from January to July, a 61.8% year-on-year increase, said Shen Danyang, Spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). July’s ODI reached CNY91.01 billion, down 9.5% month-on-month. During the first seven months of the year, China’s ODI surpassed its foreign direct investment (FDI), meaning it was a net capital exporter. During the same period, China’s FDI rose 4.3% year-on-year to CNY491.51 billion. The United States and Germany were among the most popular investment destinations for Chinese companies. During the seven-month period, ODI in both countries more than doubled from a year earlier. Large overseas mergers and acquisitions contributed to the ODI growth. From January to July, China’s overseas M&amp;As totaled USD54.3 billion, accounting for more than half of the total ODI. The M&amp;A value in the first seven months of 2016 surpassed the volume registered for the whole of 2015. From January to July, there were M&amp;As by Chinese enterprises in 63 countries and regions, covering 15 sectors including information transmission, services, software and manufacturing. By the end of July, China’s accumulated investment under the Belt and Road Initiative hit USD51.1 billion, taking up 12% of the country’s total ODI.
