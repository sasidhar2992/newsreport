LONDON ( Alliance News ) - Home and garden product wholesaler MBL Group PLC announced it had made a slight pretax profit in its full-year results to the end of March 2016 after losses the previous year, as it looks to reduce its reliance on a home entertainment market in &quot;long term decline&quot;. 

MBL made a pretax profit of GBP26,000 for the full-year compared to a GBP883,000 loss the previous year. The previous year&apos;s loss included a GBP450,000 impairment to intangible assets. Group revenue increased 14% to GBP14.8 million from GBP13.0 million . 

Revenue increase was largely driven by its mail order Garden and Home division where sales grew by 37% to GBP5.9 million from GBP4.3 million in 2015. Revenues in its wholesale CD and DVD distribution were broadly flat at GBP8.9 million compared to GBP8.7 million in 2015. 

&quot;We have been committed to diversifying the group&apos;s operations to reduce our reliance on the home entertainment market, which has been in long term decline. Our strategy is to manage the home entertainment division and to grow our developing Garden &amp; Home brands and to establish new brands when opportunities arise to take advantage of the existing infrastructure&quot; said Chairman Tony Johnson
. 
&quot;The year has started well and sales in both divisions are in line with management expectations&quot; Johnson added. 

MBL shares were up 6.9% to 15.50 pence .
