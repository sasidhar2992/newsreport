SPOKANE, Wash. - Two wildfires in the Spokane area have destroyed several buildings and forced the evacuation of hundreds of people, the Spokane Spokesman-Review reports. A fire in north Spokane that is one-sixth of a square mile in size has burned buildings and led authorities to issue a mandatory evacuation order on Sunday, the newspaper reports. The Spokesman-Review says the evacuation boundaries are Valley Springs on the south, Thierman Road on the east, Joseph Lane on the north and a west boundary due north and south of Joseph Lane. Spokane fire officials say the blaze is not under control. KREM TV in Spokane reports 2-5 homes have been lost, as well as 5-10 outbuildings. The second uncontrolled fire started Sunday afternoon near Spangle, Washington, which is south of Spokane. The blaze, which covers 9 square miles, has destroyed several homes so far, Spokane County Fire District 3 tells the newspaper. Fire officials say the fire began in a wheat field and is moving quickly through dry brush. 
So far, there are no reported injuries from the fires. 
The Spokane County Fairgrounds have opened for emergency animal sheltering. Both large and small animals will be accepted. Dogs on leashes, cats in carriers or containers Horses on halters and lead rope Bring special food and/or medications with special instructions Please make sure you check-in when you arrive
