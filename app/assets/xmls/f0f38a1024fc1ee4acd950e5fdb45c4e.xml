Supported NGO «The Crimea Center of Business and Cultural Cooperation «Ukrainian House» within the framework of the project &quot;Return of the Crimea.&quot;In the Crosshairs&quot; of the society&quot; by the Media Development Fund of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. The views of the authors do not necessarily reflect the official position of the U.S. Government. 
The Crimean Centre for Business and Cultural Cooperation ‘Ukrainian House’, founded in 1999 and until recently based in Simferopol, Crimea before being forced to flee, is creating an information centre `Voice of Crimea’. The centre will cover the developments in Crimea through a web platform and daily TV programme ‘Pod Pritselom’ [In the spotlight], as well as a weekly analytical programme `Voice of Crimea’, broadcast in Russian, Ukrainian and English. EED support comes at an early phase and will complement other start-up funding.
