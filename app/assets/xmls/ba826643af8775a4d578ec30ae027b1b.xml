Kaine to address ironworkers union, with help from dad By Alan Suderman    1 photo  
LAS VEGAS (AP) — Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine is set to try and shore up labor support with a little help from his dad. 
Tim Kaine will address the ironworkers&apos; union annual convention in Las Vegas on Monday. He&apos;ll be accompanied by his father, Al Kaine, who owned a union-organized ironwork and welding shop in the Kansas City, Missouri, area where Tim Kaine grew up. 
Al Kaine held Iron Crafters for more than 20 years, and his three sons, including the Democratic candidate, often worked at the shop. 
Major unions have endorsed Tim Kaine&apos;s running mate, Hillary Clinton, but Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump hopes to win support from rank-and-file members. Trump has said Clinton is beholden to Wall Street, while his policies on trade and immigration would help the working class.
