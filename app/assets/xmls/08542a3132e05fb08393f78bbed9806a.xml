Print Email Man Breaks Into House, Drinks Bottle Of Rum, Then Falls Asleep On Sofa Dawid Grzelewski, 32, broke into Paul Hatton ’s home in Bournemouth, Dorset , while he was at work. Mr Hatton received an alert to tell him that his burglar alarm had been activated so he went home, took pictures of the sleeping burglar, kicked him out of his flat then called police. He was soon spotted in bushes by police nearby with a bag of amphetamine in his mouth and arrested. Prosecutor Simon Edwards told Bournemouth Crown Court : &quot;Mr Hatton received an alarm telling him the burglar alarm in the flat had been activated. ‘At 8.30am Mr Hatton went to the flat and found the defendant asleep on the sofa in the lounge. ‘He took two photographs of him on his mobile phone. Next to [the defendant] was a hammer and a large screwdriver. ‘He had drunk a quantity of rum belonging to Mr Hatton.’ Mr Edwards added: Police attended and a blood-stained tissue was found on a worktop. ‘The defendant had injured himself. [The blood] matched the profile of this defendant.&quot; Grzelewski, of no fixed abode, admitted charges of burglary, possession of a class B drug and breaching a suspended sentence. He asked for one further domestic burglary and three commercial burglaries to be taken into consideration by the judge. He was jailed for 60 weeks and will be extradited to Poland when he is released. Share to:
