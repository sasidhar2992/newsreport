Amritsar kidnapping: Accused sent to a day’s police remand HT Correspondent, Hindustan Times, Amritsar | Updated: Aug 22, 2016 12:10 IST Cops trying to hide the accused from the media glare outside a court in Amritsar on Sunday. (Sameer Sehgal/HT ) 
A day after police cracked the kidnapping of software engineer Amandeep Singh with the arrest of five, including sleuths of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB), a local court here sent the accused to a day’s police custody on Sunday.

Police tried their best to hide the accused from the media glare as they were brought to the court. The five accused—Jasminder Singh, a head constable with the IB; Manjit Singh, a constable with the CBI; Varun Sareen, an employee with the Suvidha Centre of DC office; Paramjit Singh, a relative of Jasminder and one Manmohan Singh, a driver.

Police had parked three-four vehicles on the court premises to not let the photojournalist click their pictures. To avoid the media, the police brought out the accused from two different points, bundled them into the vehicle and sped away. The faces of all the accused were covered. 
As there is involvement of the men from the intelligence agencies in the kidnapping of Amandeep, police are reluctant to speak and share details. 
Police are yet to arrest two more suspects, Pawan Kumar, a sub-inspector with the IB and one Dharamveer Singh. 
On Friday night Canada-returned software engineer Amandeep was kidnapped from the Civil Lines area. As police got a tip off, Amandeep was rescued and five accused were arrested. 
The moment police found that the men from central agencies were among those arrested, they were treading with caution. As per information, some business rivalry was said to be the reason behind the kidnapping. 
It is learnt that some people known to the victim had hatched the conspiracy to extort money from the victim. Tags
