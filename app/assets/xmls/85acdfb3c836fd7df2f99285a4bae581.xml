Philadelphia’s Jewelers Row Threatened, Reports Say   
Wow, it’s almost as if property owners think they have the right to do what they think best with their property.“This is my life they’re screwing with.” Yes, theirs and their shareholders too, it’s called business. Maybe the politicians on a national level who believe developers are evil (all the while taking their contributions and speaking fees) and tell the little people they will siphon money from those who have it and hand it over to those who don’t, will pass a law. The nerve of those developers expecting their investment of hundreds of millions to turn a nasty profit. Yes I’m an estate jeweler and diamond broker for 40 years but I own the hundred year old brick building I occupy…that’s how you control a property’s use and future. But an opportunity to redevelop it for the profit that investments are made for would find my landlord company sending my jewelry company an eviction notice. Link:
