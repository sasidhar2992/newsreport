As Nigeria’s Under-23 football team departs the Rio Olympics with the only medal won by Team Nigeria – a bronze medal – Nigerians look to Katsuya Takasu, a Japanese cosmetic surgeon, with gratitude. 
It was Mr. Takasu who doled out $390,000 to the team over their performance at the Games in spite of the drama that accompanied, and remained with them, in Rio. 
But the team’s journey to the solitary prize would not be complete without Katsuya Takasu, a Japanese plastic surgeon, who doled out $390,000 for their performance. 
Throughout the Olympics, the ‘Dream Team VI’ hugged more headlines off the pitch than on it. When it wasn’t arriving the venue of the Olympics just hours before their first game due to inability to foot their air fare, it was the players threatening to boycott the Games over nonpayment of allowances. 
“I read about the financial problems affecting the team and I felt the need to make a big contribution,” Mr. Takasu had told the BBC earlier in the week. 
Prior to the Olympic Games, Nigerians knew little about Mr. Takasu, who likes to describe himself as the man who had rejuvenated himself “by 15 years” using the latest technologies and innovations in the field of cosmetic surgery 
Born on January 22, 1945, to Toyoko Takasu and Shogo Matsuzaki, Mr. Takasu studied at the Showa School of Medicine in Tokyo in 1969, before travelling to Germany and Italy where he learnt plastic and cosmetic surgery. 
He returned to his hometown, Ishiki, Hazu-gun, in 1974 to establish Takasu General Hospital. Over the next decade, a chain ofTakasu clinics had sprung up in Nagoya, Osaka, Tokyo, Hiroshima, and other parts of the country. 
In the same period, he became a regular face on Japanese TV programmes where he discussed cosmetic surgery and liposuction. 
He also travelled around the world delivering lectures with such topics as ‘Rejuvenation of Myself,’ ‘Liposuction Using Turn Operating Table,’ ‘Combination of Single Hair Grafting and Automatic Hair Transplant System,’ ‘Facelift without Incision.’ 
In 2001, he was awarded the ‘Leader in Cosmetic Leader in Millenium.’ 
“Cosmetic surgery has become more popular than ever. This is a truly pleasing phenomenon for me since I have devoted my whole life to the prosperity of cosmetic surgery,” Mr. Takasu stated on his personal website . 
“Through the thorny path of cosmetic surgery, those who constantly encouraged me were my patients who gained beauty, youthfulness and most importantly ‘positive thinking.’ It is my task to encourage positive thinking by the means of cosmetic surgery.” 
In 1987, Mr. Takasu performed the first ever liposuction in Japan, having learned the technique from Pierre Founier in Paris, France. 
As a rule, Mr. Takasu tests out innovative medical procedures on his own face and body before performing them on patients. As a result, he had carried out on himself several facelifts, upper and lower blepharoplasty (plastic surgery that corrects defects, deformities, and disfigurations of the eyelids), high definition liposuction, hair transplant, and buccal fat removal, among others. 
In 2003, he visited Dr. Patrick Frechet’s Clinic in Paris for the latest hair transplantation techniques. One year later, he was at Dr. Eduardo King’s Clinic in Caracas, Venezuela, for the latest cosmetic surgery techniques. 
Mr. Takasu has authored several books including New Method of Augmentation Mammaplasty (1992), Cosmetic Surgery by Doctor Katsuya Takasu (1994), and Self-Treatment for Facial Rejuvenation (1996). 
He is also known for his philanthropy. Following the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995 which led to the death of almost 7,000 people and injury to over 40,000, Mr. Takasu established Organization of Cosmetic Surgery Volunteers along with surgeons from nine other clinics. They offered free plastic and reconstructive treatments to the earthquake victims. 
He is married to Shizu Hoshino and they have three children – Rikiya, Hisaya, and Mikiya.
