Rural church among those providing aid after Louisiana flood By Associated Press | August 21, 2016 @ 3:33 pm 
Members of the South Walker Baptist Church led by pastor Mark Carroll, center, pray at the conclusion of what is normally a time for Bible study, but which became an informal talk about experiences during the flood in Walker, La., Sunday, Aug. 21, 2016. The church was an island of high ground in a community flooded with 4-5 feet of water a week earlier. During and since the flood the church is serving as a shelter and food distribution point for the community. (AP Photo/Max Becherer)
