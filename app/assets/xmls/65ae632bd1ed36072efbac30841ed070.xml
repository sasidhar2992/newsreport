LANSING - Tim Boring studies some of the headier issues facing Michigan&apos;s agriculture industry. 
In his role with the Michigan Agri-Business Association, the 37-year-old Stockbridge native searches for new and potentially better ways to till fields, rotate crops, improve crop quality, reduce farm runoff and find new market opportunities. 
In his other life, he cultivates 500 acres of corn, soybeans and wheat on the sixth-generation family farm he grew up on. The two pursuits go hand in hand, he said. 
&quot;I grew up in Michigan, I have a farm here, and I am fully vested in doing what I can to improve Michigan agriculture,&quot; Boring said. &quot;We&apos;re working on things that need to be worked on, looking at trends, looking at how we can better position our industry for long-term success.&quot; 
The East Lansing-based MABA speaks on behalf of a broad spectrum of the state&apos;s agriculture industry, including seed producers, feed suppliers, grain handlers, food processors, retailers and advisers. It also provides training and educational programs in a broader mission to help Michigan&apos;s ag industry find new opportunities to grow and diversify. 
The state already produces more than 300 commercial commodities - second only to California - and ranks first in the production of 18 of those commodities, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture &amp; Rural Development. Field crops, alone, generate about $6 billion annually. Livestock and dairy accounts for another $5 billion. 
As vice president of MABA, Boring created the association&apos;s Certified Fertilizer Applicator program and manages the Certified Crop Adviser program. He leads presentations to policy makers and the public on issues including nutrient loss and water quality concerns. The industry is searching for ways to keep soil nutrients from washing into waterways and contributing to harmful algal blooms. 
&quot;We&apos;re out there working with retail members and crop advisers, listening to them, talking to them,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re out there talking to producers a little bit. We spend a lot of time with universities. We spend time with environmental groups, talking to non-traditional groups.&quot; 
That type of pursut would seem logical for someone who has been involved in farming all his life. 
Boring lives in an old farmhouse on what used to be his uncle&apos;s farm, about a quarter-mile away from where he grew up. 
&quot;I spent all my time on the farm,&quot; he said. &quot;Onward from 11 years old, I was basically working full time. At 14, I was driving a fork truck every day. It&apos;s something I knew I always wanted to do.&quot; 
Boring earned a bachelor&apos;s degree in agri-science and master&apos;s and doctoral degrees in crop and soil sciences at MSU. He did research and taught undergraduate courses at the university before becoming research director for the Michigan Soybean Promotion Committee. He moved to the MABA about two years ago. 
&quot;We can look at the big picture, but if you can&apos;t relate that back to what we’re doing on day-to-day basis, then that long-range focus isn’t likely to be as beneficial or insightful,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s got to be tied back into the day-to-day activities. We&apos;re seeing local production take on more and more value. I&apos;m interested in finding how we can do things differently to get better delivery value.&quot;
