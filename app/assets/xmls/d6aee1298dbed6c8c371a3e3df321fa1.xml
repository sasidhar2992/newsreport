A grandmother who spent her life savings on an extension has been told she has to tear down the build because it is &apos;out of character&apos; for the local area. 
Nicola Graham-O&apos;Connor, 49, spent £11,000 adding pillars, railings and a canopy to the front of her semi-detached home in Quinton, Birmingham. 
The homeowner claims she informed the council of her plans before embarking on the build and was told she did not need planning permission. 
But Birmingham City Council says Mrs Graham-O&apos;Connor did not seek any guidance and has now told her to remove her extension.

The grandmother, 49, pictured, claims she informed the council of her plans and was told she did not need permission 
Mrs Graham-O&apos;Connor, who lives with husband Adrian and their daughter, 21, said: &apos;There is no way I&apos;d invest my life savings in this if there was any doubt that it wasn&apos;t legal.&apos; 
Mrs Graham-O&apos;Connor replaced lawns and bushes outside her home with the canopy because she could no longer manage the garden. She also installed 8ft tall brick pillars and 5ft tall metal railings on the property. 
The homeowner claims that she gave the dimensions to a planning officer before starting the project three years ago but that she has now been told to take 2ft off the height of each feature. 
Birmingham City Council inspected the extension following a complaint and last week told Mrs Graham-O&apos;Connor that she had 28 days to remove the extension. 
She was also told that any bid for &apos;retrospective planning permission&apos; was unlikely to be successful. 
The homeowner said: &apos;They say it&apos;s out of character. But immediately after receiving the letter, I toured the immediate area and took 29 photographs of railings higher than mine, extensions and porches that are bigger than mine, and closed in.&apos; 
Mrs Graham-O&apos;Connor has now been told she must remove the railings, pictured, as they are &apos;out of character&apos;

Mrs Graham-O&apos;Connor, who suffers from fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis and depression, said: &apos;My health is very, very poor. I&apos;m under so much stress. I&apos;m living on my nerves and my stomach churns.&apos; 
She said she will fight the order &apos;if she can get a loan from family or friends&apos; but that she has &apos;no money left to take it down. She has also written to her councillor and local MP. 
Birmingham City Council’s head of planning management, Richard Goulborn, said: &apos;We received an anonymous complaint about development at this property. 
&apos;Following a visit by an officer a decision was made that planning permission is required for the forward canopy, pillars, gates and railings. 
&apos;Due to the scale, design and visual impact of the development planning permission is unlikely to be forthcoming so we are currently in discussion with the owner to find a solution. “ 
&apos;There is no record or evidence of this specific development being brought to the council’s attention before it was built.&apos; Most watched News videos Share Or Comment On This Article Disclaimer : Opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of Capitalbay.
