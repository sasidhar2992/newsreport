If you&apos;re heading into the city this morning be aware that there is heavy congestion on the A50 Potteries Way following an accident. 
The incident happened at the junction with the A5008 Bucknall New Road just after 8am and police say traffic queues are already building up. 
They have asked motorists to avoid the area while they deal with the accident.
