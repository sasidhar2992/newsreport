<topic_text>
In 2009, a new wave of talents hit the Nigeria music scene; most of which were a blend of western and indigenous content. 
The urban sounds generated by these artistes ushered the industry into a new era. 
Within the same period, the industry witnessed a financial boom as corporate organisations; home and abroad started to see Nigerian music artistes as a valuable and a bankable brand that can be used to communicate to their target market. 
One of such artistes who benefited from that financial boom is Chukie Edozien known by his stage name Lynxxx. 
Although the Business, Economics and Marketing graduate from the University of Hull had been doing music under a label he formed with his friend and producer, Ikon in 2004, he hadn’t done any major project until December 2009 when he released the game-changing hit, Change Your Parade. 
Before you could say jack, Lynxxx was contacted by Pepsi – who went on make him the first Nigerian ambassador for the international brand. 
With the financial backing from Pepsi, Lynxxx then went on a first-of-its-kind nationwide campus tour for the promotion of his debut album in 2010, This is Lynxxx which featured the likes of Banky W , Wizkid and more. 
The album rose to create buzz among Nigerian youths due to its fresh and dynamic content – something the artiste coined as ‘Jollof Musik’ and catch-phrases such as Utunu and Suck Belle Make the Shirt Fine popularized by the leading promotional single – Change Your Parade . 
With his business instincts kicking in, Lynxxx saw this as an opportunity and capitalised on this; setting up a clothing line called SyndiK8 Denim. 
Asides from the good quality of his music, another major ingredient for Lynxx’s rapid rise in the industry could be linked to his muscled physique. This generated a huge female fan base for the rapper. 
Following the success of his debut album, Lynxxx started working on his second album. He released the monster hit – Fine Lady featuring Wizkid as the first single in 2012. 
He later released other follow up singles. Unfortunately they didn’t achieve the same success such as his previous efforts. 
The rapper then somewhat took a 3 year break away from music to rediscover himself. He then re-appeared early this year by becoming vocal about his new found faith in God. 
This had quite a number of people thinking the rapper had now taken to gospel music but Lynxxx has on several occasions cleared that notion. 
In our #YNaijaTwitterInterview series on Friday, August 19, 2016, the CEO of Syndik8 Records however expiated on this new phase of his life which he claims will nave now influence on his music career also. 
Here is what Lynxxx – who has a new video out titled Serve You – had to tell us; #YNaijaTwitterInterview : Hello @Chukie_lynxxx What exactly is the new direction Lynxxx is heading to?
