Exhibitors reaped the rewards of the biggest AgQuip in decades. 
Fairfax Rural Events group manager Kate Nugent said the 2016 growth was driven by unseasonably fair weather and a full house of AgQuip stallholders. 
“It’s probably one of our biggest events in 20 years,” Kate said. 
“It’s a once a year opportunity to compare but exhibitors said they were seeing farmers back who they haven’t seen here in years. It’s great boost for confidence.” 
Product demonstrations were in high demand among the AgQuip attractions. Organisers plan to consolidate that market for future events. 
“Demonstrations will be a strong focus,” she said. 
Also in the woodwork is the introduction of seminar rooms. 
The rooms would offer businesses the opportunity to host guest speakers in a large forum environment and provide a key platform for future field days. 
Kate said the new initiative would help push the “information interchange” between exhibitors and consumers. 
Given the great conditions and big exhibitor list, “huge expectation” was riding on this year’s event. 
Kate said it was big relief to deliver another resounding success in what was a positive sign for future of Australian agriculture. 
The success also reinforced the importance of field days to the national farming community, especially when times are tough. 
“It’s about understanding Australia’s variable conditions and how farmers can best manage that,” she said.“We need to provide the platform [AgQuip] to help farming families survive lean times and prosper in the good times.” 
One of the leading innovators to speak at this year’s AgQuip was Anna Speer, the chief executive of online saleyard company AuctionsPlus. Anna and others Kate said, helped further the importance of women in the agricultural workforce. 
Also showing great tenacity was 2016 Brownhill Cup winner, Greg Rummery. The Walgett agronomist won the award alongside wife Lyn for the family’s work in sustainable agriculture. Latest News
