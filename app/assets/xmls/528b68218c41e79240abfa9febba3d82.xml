Former Seattle Radio Guy Posting Whatever Catches His Eye Joni Mitchell On the Mend, Snapped at Chick Corea Concert by Norm Gregory on August 21, 2016 in Music 
I can’t put into words what this woman and her music mean to me. Joni Mitchell has made a rare and welcome public appearance, some 17 months after suffering a brain aneurysm. 
The iconic Canadian singer was spotted at a Chick Corea concert at the Catalina Bar and Grill in Los Angeles on Saturday (Aug. 20). She appeared relaxed as she posed for a photo with friends, revealed on the official Joni Mitchell site the following night (Aug. 21).
