Gyorgy Schopflin, 76, suggested on Twitter that pigs&apos; heads should be placed on the border to prevent refugees from entering
A Hungarian politician has sparked outrage for suggesting placing pigs&apos; heads on fences at the border will deter refugees from entering the country. 
Gyorgy Schopflin, 76 - part of the country&apos;s right wing party - made the comment when responding to criticism about their attitude towards refugees. 
The MEP posted on Twitter that by placing the head of a pig on fences at the border it would &apos;deter&apos; people try to enter &apos;more effectively&apos;. 
Schopflin, of the Fidesz Party, was replying to Human Rights Watch director Andrew Stroehlein. 
The argument on Twitter came after Hungarian officials placed masks made from vegetables on their border fences in a bid to prevent refugees trying to enter the country. 
Mr Stroehlein tweeted: &apos;Refugees are fleeing war &amp; torture, Hungary. 
&apos;Your root vegetable heads will not deter them.&apos; 
Mr Schopflin quickly replied: &apos;Might do so. Human images are haram.

He continued: &apos;You are an embarrassment to Hungary, to Europe &amp; to humanity.&apos;

Andrew Stroehlein replied and said that the politician&apos;s words were &apos;disgusting&apos;

Of 177,135 asylum applicants to Hungary in 2015, just 146 were approved, according to government statistics. 
In March 2015, the Hungarian government declared a state of emergency in the country due to Europe&apos;s refugee crisis. 
It deployed an additional 1,500 security personnel to the country&apos;s Serbian frontier in a bid to deny refugees entry.
