A World Cup rally may have helped push many Brazilian stocks into positive territory for 2014, but it hasn’t done much for mining heavyweight Vale SA.
Shares of the world’s biggest producer of iron ore–the main component of steel–tumbled this week to their lowest level since early 2009 and are down 21% so far this year. Vale shares were up 1% at 25.75 Brazilian reais in mid-day trading.
A sharp drop in iron-ore prices during recent weeks is to blame for Vale’s share decline. Benchmark prices for the commodity are at their lowest levels since September 2012, around $90 per metric ton at Chinese ports, due to a supply glut from mining companies in Australia and slowing demand in China.
Vale’s management has long insisted that iron-ore prices below $110 per ton are unsustainable. Lower-quality mines in China start losing money when prices fall below that threshold and are forced to close, sending prices back up.
With some of the world’s best-quality ore reserves at its mines in Brazil, Vale boasts among the lowest production costs in the industry. Still, investors are debating whether it’s a good time to scoop up Vale shares on the cheap.
“We think it’s still too early to buy,” UBS analyst Andreas Bokkenheuser said in a note released Wednesday. “We do not believe Chinese stimulus will get materially more meaningful from current levels, nor do we believe marginal-cost miners will shut down in the near-to-medium term.
Mr. Bokkenheuser said investors should wait for Vale’s shares to fall another 15% or so before buying.
Rogério Freitas, a founding partner at Rio de Janeiro-based asset management firm Teórica Investimentos, said he’s bullish on Vale in the long-term. He says Vale’s company’s iron-ore operations and investment plans should remain lucrative as long as prices remain above $70 per ton.
“The price should come back at some point,” Mr. Freitas said. “We just don’t know when.”
