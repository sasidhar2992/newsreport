Born in Reading, PA to parents William and Gertrude (Beaver) Stottlemyer, Nancy married Gehret David Deppen in 1959 and resided most recently in Wellfleet, MA prior to moving to Phoenix in 2014. Besides her husband, Nancy leaves two children, Nicholas W. Deppen of Seattle, WA, and Martha G. Casebolt (Bryan) of Phoenix, as well as three grandchildren, Isaac, Claire, and Amelia. Nancy was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College class of 1953 where she majored in political science. She was initially employed by the CIA before moving to New York City in 1956. After a brief stint with Grosset and Dunlap, Nancy was hired by u.s. Committee for UNICEF to work on the Trick or Treat for UNICEF Program. Following her husband&apos;s ordination in the Episcopal Church, the couple moved first to Flossmoor, IL and later to Madison, WI. During this time Nancy and her family became regular summer visitors to the town of Wellfleet on Cape Cod, finally building their own summer home there in 1974. From 1970 until 1982, Nancy lived in St. Louis, MO, where she was active in community outreach and social justice programs. She was hired by the Episcopal Diocese of Missouri to be the Coordinator of its Hunger Task Force, a position she held for six years. After moving to Westfield, NJ in 1982, Nancy began working for the National Episcopal Church in New York City. In 1987 she was named Executive Director ofthe Consortium of Endowed Episcopal Parishes, a position that included organizing conferences and workshops around the country to educate endowed churches about the importance of responsible stewardship and the mechanics of grant writing, evaluation and meaningful investment. Nancy retired in 1995. She and David began living most of the year in Wellfleet, enjoying frequent domestic and international travel. The Deppens spent several months a year in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, for a period of eight years. In 2003 they purchased a condominium at Grayhawk in Scottsdale, AZ, wintering there before moving to the Sagewood community of Phoenix in 2014. A memorial service will take place at St. James Episcopal Church Wellfleet in summer 2017. In lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation in Nancy&apos;s name to the Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary, P.O.
