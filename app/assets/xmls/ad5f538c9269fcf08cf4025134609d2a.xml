Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has said that if former first choice goalkeeper Joe Hart wants to leave the club he can, because he just wants his players to be &quot;happy&quot;. 
The England goalkeeper has been left out of City&apos;s opening three games this season, with Guardiola close to bringing in Barcelona&apos;s Claudio Bravo as his new No.1. 
The Spanish manager wants a ball-playing keeper like he has had with Victor Valdes and Manuel Neuer at his previous clubs and Hart doesn&apos;t fit the bill. 
But Carragher believes Hart should have seen this coming and worked on this part of his game before Guardiola left Munich for Manchester. “Was he going out on to the training ground, working on his left foot and his touch?” Jamie Carragher 
Writing in the Mail , Carragher said: &quot;Gary Neville said on Monday Night Football that Hart should stay at City, that he should work on his feet and work with Guardiola to improve, but why did Hart not improve before he came? 
&quot;It was an open secret for 12 months he was coming to Manchester, one which was confirmed on February 1. 
&quot;Was Hart studying videos of Neuer and Victor Valdes to see what Guardiola wants from a &apos;sweeper keeper&apos; when the team plays such a high line? 
GETTY WORK: Carragher says Hart should have practiced his footwork 
&quot;Was he going out on to the training ground, working on his left foot and his touch? 
&quot;There were extra things that he could have done to give himself a head start.&quot; 
&quot;This has been a difficult period for Hart, following on from his ordeal at Euro 2016, but while it is not going to work out for him at City, I&apos;m sure there will be a queue of clubs keen to sign him before the end of this month&apos;s transfer window.&quot; Related articles
