Design details: Unity3D package of specific plant including 
-prefab of asset 
-Level Of Details—3 to 4 lvls including billboards (preferably in .max or .fbx) 
-Texture maps (diffuse, normal, spec/gloss) 
-materials and shaders for plant 
Can take a look at Unity asset-Custom tree exporter or look at Speedtree samples

The vertices count of the various LODs should be depending on the shape and size of the tree/plant 
Trees or larger plants 
LOD 0-- range of 8000 to 12000 
LOD 1-- range of 4000 to 8000 
LOD 2-- range of 1000 to 4000 
LOD 3—billboard 
LOD 0-- range of 4000 to 8000 
LOD 1-- range of 1000 to 4000 
LOD 2—billboard 
Ideas for the visual style: 3D Model 
Urls to draw inspiration from: [url removed, login to view]!/content/29170 
Extra notes: Please quote price per plant.
