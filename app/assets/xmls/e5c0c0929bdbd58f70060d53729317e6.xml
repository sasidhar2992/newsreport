On an upcoming episode of KBS’s “Suspicious Vacation” (tentative title), actors Kim Kang Woo and Im Hyung Joon travel to Greenland and experience the popularity of BTS. 
The two actors happen to travel in Greenland on a special day where people choose their own religions, and find a person who is celebrating it with a party. The minute the actors reveal they are Korean, a young K-pop fan shows them a picture of BTS. Im Hyung Joon then proudly reveals to her that he has a special relationship with BTS. 
In response, the young girls give him a high five and welcome them in. They are able to enjoy a meal and be more friendly with the family. The two actors can’t hide their grateful hearts and say, “We were able to eat a meal because of BTS.” Kim Kang Woo even sends a message to BTS, saying, “Thank you BTS.”
