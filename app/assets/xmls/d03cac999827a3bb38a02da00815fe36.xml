Global Spinal Cord Stimulation Market Report: 2016 Edition Size and Share Published in 2016-06-03 Available for US$ 800 at Researchmoz.us 
Description 
Chronic pain is an unpleasant sense of discomfort that persists or progresses over a long period of time. A chronic back pain can be treated through spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy. It is a process that uses soft thin wires with electrical leads to be placed in the spinal column through needle so as to cure chronic back pain. This process doesn’t eliminate the pain; it just interferes with the signals sent to the brain. The SCS surgery is performed in two stages: trial stimulation and permanent implantation. 
Spinal cord stimulation therapy is used to reduce the pain signals that are sent to the brain through spinal cord which in return release pain relief chemicals. For this process, a spinal cord stimulator also known as dorsal column stimulator, is surgically placed under the skin to send a mild electrical current to the spinal cord. The process has its advantages and disadvantages. 
The spinal cord stimulation (SCS) market is vast and remains relatively untouched with huge potential to treat widespread chronic back pain. The global SCS market is expected to increase in the coming years. The US has the chronic back pain prevalence with maximum number of addressable population and system implants.

The key factors driving the growth in the SCS market includes increasing adult population in the US, increasing demand for minimally invasive surgeries, innovation of new technologies &amp; therapies, growing cases of obesity, and rise in ageing demographics. However, there are number of factors which are hindering the growth of the SCS market like high cost associated with therapy, tough regulatory approvals, and major reliance on traditional SCS therapy. 
The report offers an in-depth analysis of the spinal cord stimulation market segmented into global SCS and regional SCS market, covering the US and outside the US market. Competition in this market is rather concentrated with a few medical device companies dominating the market, through innovation. Medical companies that have been covered in the report include Medtronic Plc., Nevro Corporation, Boston Scientific, and St. Jude Medical.
