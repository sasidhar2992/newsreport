LONDON (AP) — Britain has announced plans to house Islamist extremists in separate units in prison after a review found that some charismatic prisoners were radicalizing the wider Muslim population while incarcerated. 
The government-ordered study concluded that &quot;cultural sensitivity&quot; among National Offender Management Service staff toward Muslim prisoners went too far and &quot;could inhibit the effective confrontation of extremist views.&quot; 
The findings of the review released Monday recommended introducing the specialized units in order to stop a small number of individuals from being able to &quot;proselytize&quot; to other inmates. 
Some 12,633 Muslims were in prison in England and Wales at the end of June, compared to 8,243 a decade earlier. Of the 147 people in prison for terrorism-related offences at the end of March, all but 10 considered themselves to be Muslim.
