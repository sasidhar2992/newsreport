“I just told them, ‘Look at the highest flag, and that’s what we did.” -Carmelo Anthony, who led an inexperienced U.S. men’s basketball team to a gold medal at the Rio Summer Olympics, referring to the moment the team took to the podium and the spot where the American flag was about to rise. 
“This experience has been the dream of a lifetime for me,”– U.S. gymnast and closing ceremony flagbearer Simone Biles, who won five medals, four of them gold, in her first Olympics. 
“The Hillary people want this to all be about tone and temperament. We also want to it be about facts and figures.” -Donald Trump’s new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who insists the GOP presidential candidate is getting back on track after a stretch of gaffes and falling poll numbers.
