As floods ravaged some parts of the country, Home Minister Rajnath Singh today spoke to chief ministers of four flood-hit states -- Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Rajasthan -- and assured all central help in dealing with the disaster. 

Singh had a telephonic conversation with chief ministers Akhilesh Yadav ((UP), Harish Rawat (Uttarakhand), Nitish Kumar (Bihar) and Vasundhara Raje (Rajasthan RPT Rajasthan) this morning and took stock of the flood situation in their states. 

The chief ministers briefed the Home Minister on the flood situation and the steps taken for rescue and relief of the marooned people. 

The chief ministers also told Singh about the operations carried out by the National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Forces in affected areas. 

&quot;I assured the Chief Ministers of full cooperation from the Centre in the flood mitigation drive launched by the states,&quot; an official statement said. 

The Ganga had yesterday crossed the danger mark in West Bengal, Bihar and neighbouring districts of Uttar Pradesh where Yamuna river is also in spate, while heavy rainfall has created a flood-like situation in some parts of Rajasthan where six persons have died so far.(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
