CANYON COUNTY - One person died and several others were injured when a minivan and a semi truck collided in a rural Canyon County intersection Sunday afternoon, Idaho State Police said. 
The crash happened around 4:45 p.m. at the intersection of Marsing and Riverside roads, west of Lake Lowell. Police on scene said it appears that the driver of the minivan ran a stop sign just before the crash happened. 
Investigators believe at least six people were in the van. Three of them were ejected from the vehicle and the driver had to be extricated, police said. 
At this point, there is no word on the exact number of injured, or the extent of injuries, but two air ambulances were dispatched to the scene. 
The driver of the semi was not injured. Loading... One person died and several others were injured in a crash in Canyon County west of Lake Lowell Sunday afternoon.

Police are asking for the public&apos;s help finding the driver of a third vehicle that may have witnessed the crash. The vehicle is described as black full-size crew cab Dodge pickup, with all-terrain tires and tinted windows. It was last seen leaving the area northbound on Riverside Road. Investigators believe the three occupants of the truck were Hispanic. 
The roads around the crash were still blocked Sunday evening as crews worked to clear the scene.
