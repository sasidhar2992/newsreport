Jeweler Sues Insurer Over Diamonds Tossed in Garbage   
I find it difficult to believe there is an appendix to any jewelers coverage that allows for what I perceive as “personal negligence.” 
Why wouldn’t there be a dozen cases of jewelers accidentally losing a million dollars worth of loose Diamonds more often? And collect on the inflated estimated value?? Or just because they got divorced and need to pay off their spouse?? 
It smells fishy to me. Link:
