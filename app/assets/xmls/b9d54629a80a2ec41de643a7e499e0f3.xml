Vietnam War Veteran John Pummell carries a flag while the hearse carrying Hatch Police Officer Jose Chavez approaches the Pan American Center for a public funeral in Las Cruces, N.M., Sunday, Aug. 21, 2016. Chavez, who was fatally shot during a traffic stop, was remembered Sunday as a man who worked tirelessly to get a job in law enforcement, ultimately winning over the small village he was charged with protecting.
