Shop Widget 15 Best Backpacks for Back-to-School Here&apos;s how to pick the right backpack for your child&apos;s needs—and one that will last the whole school year! 
The backpack is an essential part of back-to-school attire, and there are a number of factors to consider when choosing the right one. It should be durable so it can withstand being dropped (a lot), stepped on in the back of the car and shoved into a locker time after time. Ergonomic design is critical to ensure there’s no strain on your kid’s back and straps should be well-padded so they won’t hurt small shoulders. Affordability is top-of-mind as well. Of course a backpack worthy enough to carry into class everyday has to look good, too! 
Save Your Sanity Tip: Before packing your littles’ backpack on day one, add a garbage bag (like a tie n’ toss garbage bag ) to the bottom of it, folded to fit just lining the bag. This will keep the bottom of the bag waterproof and provide your kidlet with a bag if they need it for artwork, gym clothes, shoes or even a makeshift rain cover for their bag. If they use it replace it; if they don’t it won’t get in the way! 
We’ve rounded up 15 great backpacks worth considering for the upcoming school year.
