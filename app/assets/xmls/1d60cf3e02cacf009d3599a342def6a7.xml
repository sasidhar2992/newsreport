It is reported that the steel production in Tangshan, Hebei, China has been slashed by 22 million tonnes in a bid to fight against the air pollution and the issue of over supply as the steel mills in Tangshan area accounts for the half of production capacity in China.
On the other hands, Tangshan Iron and Steel Group (Tangsteel), the major steel mill in Tangshan, signed a strategic cooperation framework agreement with German technology giant Siemens Limited on an energy saving and environmental protection cooperation.
Tangshan is famous for its industrial output that generates air pollution from the production of steel, cement, coking coal and electric power. The plan is to cut iron making and crude steel production capacity by 28 million tonnes and 40 million tonnes respectively.
