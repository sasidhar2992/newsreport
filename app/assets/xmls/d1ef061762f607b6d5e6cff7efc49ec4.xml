Gold traded near a three-week high in New York as the U.S. Federal Reserve said interest rates will remain low, boosting demand for the precious metal as an alternative investment.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank plans to keep its interest-rate target low for a considerable time after it ends bond-buying, sending the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index to the lowest level this month. The central bank said it would cut bond purchases by another $10 billion, to $35 billion, as expected by analysts. Gold ended a 12-year rally in 2013 on expectations that the central bank would scale back stimulus put in place to fuel growth.
“The FOMC policy statement did not contain major surprises, although at the margin, the general tone was probably more dovish than expected,” analysts including Edel Tully at UBS AG said in a report. “In effect, the lack of an aggressive Fed is gold-supportive.”
Gold for August delivery increased 0.7 percent to $1,281.80 an ounce at 7:18 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The precious metal climbed to $1,285.10 on June 16, the highest level since May 27, amid concern that unrest in Iraq and Ukraine would increase demand for bullion as a haven. Futures trading volumes were 19 percent lower than the average for the past 100 days for this time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Gold for immediate delivery in London rose 0.3 percent to $1,281.81 an ounce, according to Bloomberg generic pricing.
The Federal Open Market Committee cut asset purchases at the end of a two-day meeting for the fifth straight time. Fed participants estimated long-term growth for the U.S. economy of 2.1 percent to 2.3 percent, compared with 2.2 percent to 2.3 percent in March and 2.5 percent to 2.8 percent in January 2010 in the wake of the most recent recession.
Silver Rises
Silver for July delivery rose 0.8 percent to $19.945 an ounce in New York, after climbing earlier to $19.98, the highest since May 14. The metal for immediate delivery in London traded at $19.9528. Members of the London Bullion Market Association will hear proposals tomorrow on alternatives to the 117-year-old London silver fixing benchmark that’s ending in August. The agreement should be reached by the market and announced in early July, LBMA said today.
Platinum for July delivery in New York added 0.4 percent to $1,456 an ounce, while palladium for September delivery advanced 0.5 percent to $826.50 an ounce.
Platinum producers in South Africa are seeking more meetings with the biggest union to discuss a compromise on new pay demands delaying a settlement of a 21-week strike. The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union submitted additional terms that companies say are unaffordable. South Africa is the biggest platinum and second-largest palladium producer.
