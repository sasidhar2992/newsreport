LONDON--Irish building materials company Kingspan Group PLC (KRX.DB) Monday hiked its dividend payment after posting 50% jump in adjusted operating profit for the first six months of the current year.
The insulated panels manufacturer said operating profit, before amortization costs, for the six months June 30 totaled 167.3 million Euros ($186.87 million), up from adjusted operating profit of EUR111.7 million in the year ago period.
Pretax profit for the interim period grew to EUR154.8 million, from EUR100.4 million, on a revenue of EUR1.47 billion and EUR1.24 billion, respectively. Trading margin expanded by 240 basis points to 11.4%.
&quot;These results reflect our strongest ever six month performance, underpinned by solid organic growth and a robust contribution from the Joris Ide and Vicwest businesses acquired last year,&quot; Chief Executive Officer Gene Murtagh said.
&quot;The expansion in profit margin has helped deliver a 50% increase in trading profit, and with good order intake momentum in the second quarter continuing into the current trading period, we expect a solid performance in the second half,&quot; Murtagh added.
Kingspan has declared a interim dividend of 10.0 cents per share, up 25% from 8.0 cents paid a year ago.
