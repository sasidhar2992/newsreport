MORE than £1600 was raised on Saturday during a football match with a difference in Galashiels. 
The fundraiser for the Margaret Kerr Unit at the Borders General Hospital involved 30 local players... of all abilities. 
And they had to play out the final minutes of the match with a RUGBY ball. 
The encounter took place at the 3G Arena in Netherdale immediately following the Gala Fairydean Rovers versus Edinburgh University Lowland League clash. 
The entertaining game finished 3-3 and even penalties could not separate the sides consisting of mixed teams of men and women. 
Organiser Rob Goudie from Tweedbank was delighted to have exceeded his original £1500 target for the unit which provides in-patient specialist palliative care. 
Rob told us: &quot;We wanted to have fun and raise money for an important cause and we certainly did both. 
&quot;In recent months a few people close to me have lost their battles with illness. 
&quot;My idea for the match came following the deaths of Rosie Green, Mary Kapelle, Susan McIver and Dorothy Hughes. 
&quot;The common denominator with all these people was the care that the Margaret Kerr unit provided in the final weeks of their lives and I wanted to give something back to such a fantastic place.&quot; 
Along with the sponsorship raised by the competing players and a bake-sale by Ellie Fairgreive a fund-raising raffle was also held the main prize of hospitality for two at a Gala Fairydean Rovers home game was won by Robert Little. 
Mr Goudie added: &quot;I would personally like to thank everyone who took the time to get involved either supporting, playing, cooking, donating and organising.&quot; 
&quot;Special thanks to Rob, Graeme and Alan Allison at Gala Fairydean Rovers. The families who attended last night truly appreciated it also, and now this money can go to the Margaret Kerr Unit and make a difference.&quot; 
There is still time to donate to the cause online at the crowd funding page www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/robert-goudie-1 Promoted stories
