LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(Marketwired - Aug. 22, 2016) - 
The award recognises the bank&apos;s comprehensive provision of services to Germany&apos;s companies as they engage in international trade 

Roland Boehm, Divisional Board Member, Corporates International at Commerzbank, discusses the bank&apos;s success in facilitating international trade in a video interview with World Finance 

Commerzbank has been recognised as the top commercial bank in Germany, by leading magazine, World Finance , in its &apos;Banking Awards 2016&apos;.
The magazine&apos;s editors noted that &quot;Commerzbank&apos;s commercial banking division offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to companies, the public sector and institutional clients across Germany. As the country&apos;s leader in financing for SMEs and a key part of Germany&apos;s foreign trade dealings, Commerzbank is considered a reputable and innovative organisation.&quot;
Commenting on the accolade, Boehm notes, &quot;It&apos;s a real pleasure on behalf of our employees and our clients to accept this very prestigious award. We are absolutely thrilled.&quot;
Boehm continues: &quot;As a leading German financial institution for enterprises - with over 100,000 corporate clients in the country - along with an extensive branch network of over 70 sites in over 50 countries, trade is integral to our business. Globalisation is continuing, countries are becoming ever more interrelated, and we are very keen to be an active part of that. This award reflects that we are able to offer our international corporate clients access to a substantial network of global branches and subsidiaries.&quot;
As well as being recognised as the top institution in its home market, Commerzbank has been included in World Finance &apos;s &apos;Definitive Industry Guide&apos; to commercial banks for 2016.
World Finance &apos;s annual Banking Awards have celebrated innovation and achievement in the best financial institutions worldwide since 2007. The winners - drawn from a list of nominees selected by the magazine&apos;s readership - are judged by a panel of experts and editors with a combined experience of over 230 years in financial and business journalism. 
In a video interview with the magazine, Boehm explains the challenges currently facing world trade - and why Commerzbank will play a crucial role in shaping the landscape. See the award presentation here.
