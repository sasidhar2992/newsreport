Coetzee sings Mohoje’s praises 
  22 2016 
Springboks coach Allister Coetzee hailed the performance of blindside flanker Teboho Mohoje during Saturday&apos;s win over Argentina in Nelspruit. 
Mohoje delivered a commanding performance, especially on defence where he made 13 tackles and justified his selection after he came in to the starting line-up as a replacement for the injured Siya Kolisi. 
And Coetzee was understandably delighted with the Mohoje&apos;s effort during the 80 minutes. 
&quot;I’ve never felt there was a problem for us at blindside flank,&quot; he said. 
&quot;We’ve got two number sixes in Francois (Louw) and Jaco (Kriel). With Siya Kolisi out we’ve got Oupa at seven. 
&quot;I didn’t pick Oupa because Siya was injured, but because I believe he can effectively play that role at number seven. 
&quot;He’s an out-and-out lineout specialist‚ he has a high work rate‚ and he’s also got good pace‚ and that’s what we want from our loosies. 
&quot;He showed why he was in winning sides against Australia and New Zealand in 2014‚ and there’s really no doubt he’s a quality player. He has had injury problems in the past‚ but we’ve seen what value he can add at blindside flank.&quot; 
Mohoje missed out on selection for the Boks during their 2-1 series win over Ireland in June and he had to be satisfied with a place in the South Africa &apos;A&apos; side during their two-match series against the England Saxons. 
&quot;For me‚ playing in the SA &apos;A&apos; side certainly gave me some confidence‚ and so when this opportunity to play for the Boks came around‚ I just knew that I needed to do whatever I could to make the most of it‚&quot; said Mohoje. 
&quot;It’s great to be part of this environment again‚ and you saw in this game how we are really playing for each other. 
&quot;When the chips were down‚ we displayed real resilience and kept on grafting for each other‚ and that gave us the edge.&quot; Share this article
