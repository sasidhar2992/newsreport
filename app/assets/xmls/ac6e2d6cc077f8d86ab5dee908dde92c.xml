GETTY WANTED: Jaap Stam has confirmed his interest in Manchester United defender Tyler Blackett 
The 22-year-old is surplus to requirements at Old Trafford and Reading hope to secure a transfer before the window closes next week. 
The Royals are in talks with United and the player but Stam remains unsure whether they will land their man. 
The former United defender told Get Reading : “I don’t know. We’re still looking for a couple of signings. “We’ve shown our interest but I don’t know if we will succeed getting him to the club” Jaap Stam 
“I know Tyler, not personally, but I know what he can do - what type of player he is, the way he can play. 
“But I don’t know yet if it’s going to happen. 
“We’ve shown our interest but I don’t know if we will succeed getting him to the club.” Related videos
