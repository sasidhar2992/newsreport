  A JON STEWART . Maybe learn your lines next time, brother! We all love our old mate Jon Stewart, and his devil-may-care attitude towards random post-retirement TV appearances. And because one good turn a year ago deserves another today, Stewart has once again found himself in the weird, wonderful, magnificent world of professional wrestling . Stewart&apos;s had a long-standing, if not somewhat odd relationship with the WWE ; appearing as the guest host of Monday Night Raw , lamenting the end of the Undertaker &apos;s mythical WrestleMania streak on &apos; The Daily Show ,&apos; and conducting a mildly entertaining feud with then-champion Seth Rollins , which culminated in the ultimate swerve when Stewart attacked John Cena at last year&apos;s WWE SummerSlam , allowing Rollins to walk away with both the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and the United States Championship . Today, the WWE held its annual summer event (the second biggest on their calendar) at its now-regular home of the Barclay&apos;s Centre in Brooklyn. Once again, Stewart was on hand to lend his particular brand of assistance, this time to the * begins hip gyration * WWE World Tag Team Champions The New Day . Filling in for the &quot;injured&quot; Big E , Stewart donned the stable&apos;s trademark unicorn horn to introduce Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods , and also, presumably, to prove that he is not, in fact, booty. Now if only Stewart had had a wee toot on Francesca 2 , we would&apos;ve really been in business. PRO GRAPS! Source: WWE/YouTube.
