Within two months of going through the roof, prices of poultry products - broiler chicken and eggs - declined sharply due to falling consumer demand on auspicious month of Shrawan, when a large number of observant Hindus turn vegetarian, as well as transport disruptions in northern India following the Kashmir unrest. 
Data compiled by poultry trade website papaak.com showed (Mota) broiler chicken prices in Vizag have fallen by nearly 30% in the past month to trade currently at Rs 61 a kg as compared to Rs 87 a kg about a month ago. Similarly, broiler chicken in Darbhanga (Bihar) is being sold at Rs 69 a kg now, a 12.7% decline from its prevailing market price of Rs 79 a kg one month ago. Overall, broiler chicken prices have plunged by over 45% over the last two months. 
“Precisely, the unrest in Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K) has blocked road transport from the north including Punjab and Haryana to the major consumer markets in J&amp;K. So, the supply disruption from the north resulted into a sharp decline in the prices of broiler chicken in this region. Steadily, the trend spilled over to other parts of the country also including Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,” said said K G Anand, General Manager, Venketeshwara Hatcheries.  
“The supply disruption also coincided with the auspicious month of Shrawan and other festivals in various parts of the country…. So, demand of poultry products declined sharply during the last two-months.” 
The sharp decline in broiler chicken prices has been a double whammy for farmers, whose margins have been squeezed between falling finished products’ prices and rising raw material costs. As a consequence, most medium and small size farmers have reduced their production capacity which will likely reduce availability during the ensuing peak demand season after Diwali. 
Raw material prices have shot up sharply with corn quoted at Rs 18 a kg as against Rs 15 a kg about a month ago. Similarly, soya prices have shot up to Rs 36 a kg now from Rs 31 a kg around same time in July. 
According to industry sources, the current prevailing price of Rs 50-60 a kg of broiler chicken works out to at least 20% lower than the average industrywide production cost of Rs 75 a kg. So, chicken farmers are currently losing Rs 15-25 a kg on production.  
Along with chicken, the price of eggs has also fallen sharply in the last two months. In the popular Akola market, eggs are currently quoted at Rs 3.20 a piece, 26.4 per cent lower than the prevailing price of Rs 4.35 a piece one month ago. Similarly, egg at Rs 3.35 a piece in Hyderabad today stands 19.5 per cent lower than Rs 4.16 a piece about a month ago. 
“It is a seasonal decline factor which comes every year. Interestingly, the industry prepares itself for this decline every year to have minimum impact but farmers’ plight continues,” said Ramesh Khatri, President, Poultry Federation of India. 
Typically, poultry farmers see the average price for the year and not for a month or to two to plan their business. The industry, therefore, plans to draw a long term plan to reduce their seasonal losses. 
“While raw material prices are expected to decline with the commencement of kharif harvesting in October-November, it would coincide with the end of festival season and therefore, demand of chicken and eggs would increase. So, poultry farmers would need to wait for at least two months to see improvement in their realization,” said Anand.
