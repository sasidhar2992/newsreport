Oil prices are diving on Monday morning in response to a downbeat note from Morgan Stanley .
UK Brent is down 1.93% to $49.90 as of 8.00 a.m. BST (3.00 a.m. ET): Investing.com 
Crude oil is even worse, down 2% to $48.13: Investing.com 
The price of the black stuff is responding to a downbeat note from Morgan Stanley , quashing hopes of a production freeze from OPEC.
Oil had been rallying throughout August, climbing from $41.51 a barrel on August 2 to over $50 a barrel in recent weeks. It was buoyed by comments from Russia and Saudi Arabia hinting that they could freeze or cap production. Russia&apos;s oil minister Alexander Novak told a Saudi newspaper the pair would &quot;put in place joint measures to achieve oil market stability.&quot; 
But Adam Longson, head of energy commodity research at Morgan Stanley, said in a recent note that &quot;meaningful OPEC production agreement as highly unlikely&quot;, suggesting that there are simply &quot;too many headwinds and logistical challenges to a meaningful deal.&quot; ( You can read more on that note here. )
That means more oil is being pumped out by the likes of Saudi Arabia and Russia, flooding the market with excess capacity. Hence the sliding prices.
NOW WATCH: MALCOLM GLADWELL: ‘Anyone who gives a single dollar to Princeton has completely lost their mind&apos;
