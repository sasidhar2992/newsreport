SAINTS forward Jay Rodriguez is set for a loan move to West Brom, it has been reported. 
The 27-year-old has struggled after a lengthy-injury lay-off but came on as a substitute in Friday&apos;s 2-0 defeat against Manchester United. 
He has failed to force his way into the starting line-up and reports in the Daily Telegraph suggest he will be allowed to move to the midlands to get his career back on track. 
Former Burnley player Rodriguez has not played regularly since he ruptured his knee ligaments in a game against Manchester City in April 2014. 
He made an initial comeback in August of the following year but suffered a further foot problem and was forced to undergo surgery.
