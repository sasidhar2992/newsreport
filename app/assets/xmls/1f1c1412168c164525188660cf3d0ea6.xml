GETTY PURSUIT OVER: Arsenal are no longer chasing Alexandre Lacazette 
The France international had been a leading target for Arsene Wenger as he looked to add a new striker to his squad. 
Wenger had turned his attentions to Lacazette after missing out on Leicester star Jamie Vardy, who snubbed a move to the Emirates Stadium to sign a new contract with the Premier League champions. 
Arsenal had a £29m bid for Lacazette rejected last month and The Times say they have now ended their pursuit of the 25-year-old. 
Lyon had been adamant that their star striker would not be sold and the Daily Telegraph reported earlier this month that they had raised their asking price to £60m following the Gunners&apos; failed bid. 
Lacazette has made a blistering start to the new season, scoring five goals in Lyon&apos;s first two league games. 
But with Lacazette also stating his attention to remain at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais , Wenger has now given up on the striker. Related videos
