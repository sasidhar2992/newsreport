THE Bernard Park drainage basin in Northam is set to undergo a major facelift. 
Shire of Northam chief executive officer Jason Whiteaker said the project would improve the operation of the town’s drainage system and improve the park’s overall amenity at the same time. 
He also believed it would encourage more people to use the swan enclosure that will still provide a safe nesting site for them. 
The basin will be drained and dug out to remove built-up sediment. A plan of the proposed drainage works at Bernard Park. 
Adjustments will be made to the drainage inlets to improve water levels and a new levee wall with spillway will be constructed. 
Viewing platforms are being installed along with footpaths and park furniture to increase access and functionality of the space. 
New fencing and extensive new garden beds will add to create a more appealing public open space with improved amenities for park users and local wild life. 
During this time the swans will be monitored by the Shire rangers to ensure their safety during the works. 
The Shire of Northam apologises for any inconvenience during this period. Latest News
