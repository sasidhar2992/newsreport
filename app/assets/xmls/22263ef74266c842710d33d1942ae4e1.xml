Where to get the best freakshakes in Australia August 22.2016 5:18 pm decadent milkshake with donut. Photo: istock 
It’s the trend taking the foodie world by storm, the freakshake. 
Love them or hate them, these modern milkshakes are popping up everywhere (and we don’t just mean on Instagram). 
Since their creation in a small Canberra cafe, freakshakes have come to menus across the country. And we’re not complaining. 
Here is our guide to some of Australia’s most delicious, decadent and downright crazy freakshakes. 
Sugar Buns 
Sugar Buns has put the mega into megashake. 
The bakery-cafe’s epic creations come in flavours such as Candyland, Chocoholic and Malteaser, but get in early because they’re known to sell out quickly. 1a/55 Hallam Road, Hampton Park, VIC (03) 8782 0396
