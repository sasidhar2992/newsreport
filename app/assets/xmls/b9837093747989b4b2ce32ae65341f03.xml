MIDEAST STOCKS-Gulf may be soft after oil, global bourses pull back 22 August, 2016 
A trader monitors stocks at a Saudi Bank in Dammam October 26, 2008. REUTERS/Stringer Reuters/Stringer DUBAI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Gulf stocks may be soft on Monday after the global environment weakened, with oil and Asian equities pulling back amid concern that a U.S. Federal Reserve gathering this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming may signal the U.S. central bank is gearing up to hike interest rates. Brent crude has dropped 1.3 percent to $50.20 a barrel in Asian trade while MSCI&apos;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan is down 0.7 percent. There is little fresh, positive news to push Gulf markets up. Dubai&apos;s stock index , last at 3,560 points, has retreated twice since last week from technical resistance at its April peak of 3,605 points. Dubai-listed GFH Financial may attract interest after it said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Bahrain&apos;s Bank Al Khair for a potential acquisition of a majority stake in the bank. GFH said the acquisition would create a larger financial group with operations in the Gulf, Britain, Malaysia, Turkey, Pakistan and India, though a deal would depend on many conditions being met including due diligence, and no financial details were given. Advertisement Saudi Arabia&apos;s index , last at 6,212 points, is close to confirming a break of technical support on its early August low of 6,226 points. This would be very bearish, triggering a major right triangle formed by the highs and lows since April and pointing down to the 5,600-point area in the medium term.
