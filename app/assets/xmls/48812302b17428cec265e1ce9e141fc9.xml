The Information Technology Department will be the first to move Wednesday, said Jodi Smith, the county’s facilities manager. Other departments, including Finance, Human Resources, the county attorney and Administration will follow suit during the next two weeks, said Pat Bingham, county spokeswoman. Those departments should be up and running at newly renovated office space in Basalt by Sept. 6, Bingham said. The county spent about $400,000 designing and renovating a space at the River Park Center, 123 Emma Road, Suite 106, that will house those workers until somewhere around mid-2018, when the new county building is slated to be finished, Smith said. The new space is an open floorplan with lots of light and windows, she said. The Basalt community has been welcoming so far, with several people stopping by to ask what is going in at the old Bristlecone Mountain Sports location, Smith said. “The community is really excited,” she said. “Rumor has it that Basalt is going to throw us a parade once we get there.” The employees slated to move next week aren’t technically the first to leave the Plaza One Building at 530 E. Main St. in Aspen. The Clerk and Recorder’s Office left several weeks ago, splitting into two separate locations in Aspen. The Recording and Motor Vehicle departments have relocated to the basement of the Vectra Bank building at 534 E. Hyman Ave., while Clerk Janice Vos Caudill and her Elections Bureau staff are at 501 E. Hyman Ave. County officials plan to produce a map showing the exact location of the Pitkin County government diaspora from Basalt to Aspen, Bingham said. That effort will include poster-size maps, which will hang in every satellite county office, as well as fliers that can be distributed outside the Plaza One building and other locations. The maps detail the locations of Plaza One departments as well as other county locations like the library, Public Works and Community Development, which will remain where they’ve been, Bingham said. The county plans to spend about $24.6 million to completely renovate the current 17,000-square-foot building. Plans also call for building a 24,000-square-foot addition onto the back of the building that will create an L-shape with Veterans Memorial Park and serve almost like a courtyard between the new building and the historic Pitkin County Courthouse next door. The new building, slated to be completed by around the summer of 2018, also will house an 8,000-square-foot underground parking garage.
