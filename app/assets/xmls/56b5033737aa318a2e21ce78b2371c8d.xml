<topic_text>

Check out the new Awwducational.com! 
All things adorable and chubby. Help us grow our collection! 
The NSFW tab has been replaced with a &apos;META&apos; tab. Any self posts concerning this sub should use this. Rules 
Chubby, fluffy, slightly bulging belly, and fat (to an extent) are all welcome here! 
Do not attack or shame owners of chubby/fat pets. If you are offended by chubbiness or fat, try /r/aww . 
No NSFW 
If an animal is too fat to walk, or appears to be in pain, it doesn&apos;t belong here. We will rely largely on the community to decide what is/isn&apos;t appropriate material. If you see something that you feel is inappropriate, downvote it! If the animal is in obvious pain, let us know by reporting it. Our Friends
