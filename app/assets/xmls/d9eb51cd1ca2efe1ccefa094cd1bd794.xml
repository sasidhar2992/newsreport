U.K. stocks were little changed, following their worst week since before the Brexit referendum, as investors speculated on Federal Reserve policy after hawkish comments from an official.
The FTSE 100 Index rose 0.1 percent at 8:27 a.m. in London. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also added 0.1 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index advanced 0.8 percent. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said on Sunday that the U.S. economy is already close to meeting the central bank’s goals and that growth will pick up, indicating a higher probability of an interest rate increase this year.
Fresnillo Plc and Vedanta Resources Plc dropped at least 2.8 percent, leading miners lower as commodities decreased amid a stronger dollar. Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc fell as crude dropped after Iraq sought to increase exports.

The FTSE 100 has still performed better this year than its European peers, with a 10 percent gain compared with a 6.5 percent decline for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Boosted by a weaker pound and increased Bank of England stimulus, U.K. stocks have become some of the top performers among developed markets this year.
