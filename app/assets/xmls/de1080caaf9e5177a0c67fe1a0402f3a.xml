Kevin De Bruyne hails Raheem Sterling and says England fans should lay off Manchester City teammate Kevin De Bruyne 
By talkSPORT - @talkSPORT 
  
Kevin De Bruyne says he is baffled by criticism of Raheem Sterling, hailing his Manchester City teammate as a &apos;great player&apos;. 
Sterling endured a difficult first season at the Etihad after his acrimonious £44million move from Liverpool in 2015. 
He also struggled to impress at Euro 2016 and was booed by England supporters. 
But having seen the 21-year-old has start the new campaign under Pep Guardiola in fine fashion, De Bruyne cannot understand why the starlet gets so much stick. 
&quot;He&apos;s a great player. I don&apos;t care what people say about him after last year or the Euros - these things happen, footballers have ups and downs,&quot; said the Belgian. 
&quot;Hopefully he can continue this for us now because he is very dangerous. 
&quot;Obviously he&apos;s been criticised a lot in the last year but the way he&apos;s responding is great. 
&quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s really bothered about people talking about him. Everywhere he goes in England there are lots of fans of the opposing team shouting at him. 
&quot;I don&apos;t know why, because he&apos;s a great English player, they should be supporting him instead of booing him. But that&apos;s the way it goes - the City supporters will cheer him.&quot;
