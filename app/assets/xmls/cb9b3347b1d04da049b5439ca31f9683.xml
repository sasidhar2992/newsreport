  Gujarat ATS nabs two accused of 2003 Jehadi conspiracy case from MP August 22, 2016 India Ahmedabad: The Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of Gujarat has arrested two wanted accused from Burhanpur in Madhya Pradesh in connection with the 2003 “jihadi conspiracy”case. 
Shakil and Rajjak were wanted in connection with the case which was busted in 2003 by the Crime Branch here. Over 20 accused of the case were convicted by a POTA court in 2010. The case is related to the alleged recruitment of Muslim boys from madrasa and other places in Gujarat by terrorist organisations to avenge the 2002 Gujarat riots which spread after the burning of a coach of Sabarmati express in Godhara on February 27, 2002 killing 58 people mostly Karsevaks returning from Ayodhya. 
A senior officer of the ATS today said that the duo was nabbed from Burhanpur in neighbouring MP on a tip off. They had supplied arms for the conspiracy. ‘The duo has been brought here and will be produced before the court,’ the official said adding that another supplier of arms in the same case Gulam Zafar Khan was nabbed in October last year from Hyderabad after over a decade of hiding.
