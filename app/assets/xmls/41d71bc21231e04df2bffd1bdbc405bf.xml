At a recent State Council executive meeting, Premier Li Keqiang, focused on key problems concerning trade policy. Li said the sluggish global outlook and weak overseas demand have undermined efforts to shore up China’s trade volume. Rising domestic manufacturing costs also have consequences for China’s imports and exports, he said. A number of policies have been adopted by the government since 2013 to encourage the steady growth of foreign trade. Customs figures show that in the first half of 2016, China’s foreign trade stood at CNY11.13 trillion, a drop of 3.3% year-on-year. Exports amounted to CNY6.4 trillion, down by 2.1%, while imports decreased by 4.7% to CNY4.73 trillion. The country’s trade surplus increased by 5.9% to CNY1.67 trillion. “We should support steady growth both in exports and imports to advance the country’s industrial upgrade and attract new foreign investment beyond that which is already in the Chinese market,” Premier Li said. High financing costs for companies remain a major burden in maintaining trade growth. Other problems include sluggish trade policy implementation as well as outdated management methods. The government announced measures to better facilitate foreign trade development and to streamline procedures in trade gateways. Procedures for tax reimbursement for exports will be more efficient, and unnecessary harbor and shipping costs will be reduced, the China Daily reports.
