Suu Kyi returns home after five-day China trip ANI Monday 22nd August, 2016 Naypyidaw, Aug. 22 (ANI): Myanmar&apos;s Foreign Minister Aung San Suu Kyi is home after concluding her five-day trip to China where she held bilateral discussions for close coordination to promote rule-of-law in the border areas, climate change and natural disasters.
The visit was Suu Kyi&apos;s first major overseas trip since the National League for Democracy government took office in March. 
She returned to Yangon yesterday. 
According to a statement from the President&apos;s Office, various agreements have been reached between Myanmar and China. 
&quot;The two sides agreed to promote rule-of-law in the border areas, and to enhance trade, economic cooperation and various forms of friendly exchanges that would contribute to the well-being of the public,&quot; the Myanmar Times quoted the statement as saying. 
During her stay there, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to play a constructive role in Myanmar&apos;s peace process. 
While the 21st-century Panglong Conference, scheduled to start next week, aims to quell the strife between numerous ethnic groups across the country, political analyst U Than Soe Naing said Beijing&apos;s promise to promote the peace process in the borderlands are related. 
Some ethnic groups along the Myanmar border share cultural ties to the people in Yunnan province of China. 
Myanmar and China also reviewed the controversial US $3.6 billion Beijing-backed Myitsone dam project which has been frozen since 2011. (ANI) share this story
