The immigration inspection station at Shanghai Pudong International Airport expanded its self-service entry inspection channels to foreigners holding electronic passports who have residence permits for six months or longer. Previously, only registered flight crew members and expats holding permanent Chinese residence permits could enjoy the service, which takes about 10 seconds for each passenger. But first-time users must have their passports registered and their fingerprints and facial image entered into the computer system when entering China by air. This can be done at the immigration inspection station at the airport. They can then go to any one of the 27 electronic channels, each of which has two gates. They will first have their passports scanned, which will open the first gate, and the second gate will open when their fingerprints and faces are electronically recognized. The self-service system is much quicker than the traditional inspection procedures, which involves queuing for a face-to-face with an immigration official. More than one million non-foreign passengers have used the e-channels in the first half of this year. A total of 28.5 million travelers have entered or departed from Shanghai in the first half of this year, up 15% over last year, the Shanghai Daily reports.
