Latest golf odds 
South Korea&apos;s Kim Si-woo outplayed Luke Donald by five strokes to win the Wyndham Championship and with it his first PGA Tour title. 
The 21-year-old took the lead with a second-round 60 at the Sedgefield Country Club and could not be dislodged over the weekend, even though England&apos;s Donald rallied to card a three-under 67 on the final day. 
World number 115 Kim - perhaps feeling the pressure - looked wobbly over the back nine on Sunday, signing for three bogeys before pulling back a shot on the 15th, and he was then forced to wait to complete his last two holes due to inclement weather in Greensboro, North Carolina. 
He returned to the course to make par before adding gloss to his maiden victory with a birdie on the last. 
By finishing on 21-under at Sedgefield, Seoul-born Kim tied the tournament&apos;s 72-hole record, which was set by Carl Pettersson in 2008. 
Beyond Donald, who briefly pulled to within three strokes of Kim with a birdie on the 15th, Hideki Matsuyama and Brandt Snedeker shared third place on 15-under. The latter said of Kim: &quot;You had to play a perfect round of golf to catch him. If he did what he has been doing all week, he&apos;s really, really tough to catch.&quot; 
Northern Ireland&apos;s Graeme McDowell was tied for fifth on 14-under along with Thursday&apos;s joint leader Rafael Cabrera Bello, Brett Stegmaier, Johnson Wagner and Billy Horschel. 
Americans Kyle Stanley and Shawn Stefani both finished on 12-under to qualify for The Barclays in New York next week, with the latter telling pgatour.com: &quot;I knew I had to come in here and have a good week. 
&quot;Just been a whirlwind of emotions this week and I&apos;ve really felt good about my game and really love the direction my game is headed.&quot;
