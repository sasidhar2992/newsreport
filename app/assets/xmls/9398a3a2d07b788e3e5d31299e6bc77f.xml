₩3,038,940 Following the eighth volume released in May of this year, the limited edition set of the next ninth volume of Gamon Sakurai&apos;s Ajin: Demi-Human sci-fi action manga series will also include a DVD containing a newly-produced anime episode. While the first OAD was based on the &quot;File:00 Shinya Nakamura Incident&quot; episode included in the manga&apos;s second tankobon volume, the second one will focus on the daily life of the main characters: Kei, Kou, Tosaki, and Shimomura at a ryokan (Japanese style hotel) that they are using as a hiding place, and Sato and Tanaka at their secret hideout. Both the limited and book-only regular edition will be available on October 7. Preview
