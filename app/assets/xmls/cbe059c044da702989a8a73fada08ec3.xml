The Bilbao hitman who is eligible to play for Ghana suffered abuse from a section of fans, with referee Clos Gomez pausing the game midway through the first half, with players from Sporting asking their fans to stop the abuse at El Molinon. Inaki Williams, 22, became the first black player to score for Bilbao in 2014.
