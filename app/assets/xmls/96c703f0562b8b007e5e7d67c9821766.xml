Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development Minister Nyasha Chikwinya 
Zvamaida Murwira Harare Bureau Thousands of followers of the Prophetic Healing and Deliverance Ministries, including a Government minister thronged the church’s Waterfalls base yesterday a day after their leader Prophet Walter Magaya was arrested and arraigned before the court on rape charges. 
Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development Minister Nyasha Chikwinya was part of the congregation that cheered Prophet Magaya as he walked in the auditorium. 
Prophet Magaya arrived at around 3PM. 
He received a standing ovation from his followers who appeared unmoved by the allegations being levelled against their leader. 
Prophet Magaya took time to go to the overflow to greet his followers who jostled to have him lay his hand on their heads. 
In his address, Prophet Magaya avoided making reference to allegations he is facing before the court. 
He concentrated on sermons and prayers. 
Prophet Magaya and his followers took time to congratulate his wife, Tendai, who was celebrating her birthday yesterday. 
The PHD leader was wearing a matching black suit and a waistcoat. 
He was driving a black Mercedes Benz. 
On Saturday, Prophet Magaya appeared before provincial magistrate Mr Vakai Chikwekwe over rape allegations that the State is alleging occurred in June 2015. 
The state says sometime in June 2015, Magaya invited the 25-year-old complainant to a house in Mount Pleasant, Harare and allegedly showed her around the place before leaving her alone in a room. A while later, it is alleged, Magaya returned to the room in the nude and raped the complainant once. He thereafter gave her $200. The prosecutuion says the woman told her lover about the alleged abuse last month and a police report was made. 
Magaya was remanded to September 6 this year on $2 000 bail coupled with stringent conditions.
