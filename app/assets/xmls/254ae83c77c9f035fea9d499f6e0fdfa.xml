It was rather fitting that the Rio Olympic Games drew to a close as a fierce storm raged and rattled around the iconic Maracana stadium. 
A symbolic backdrop to a spectacle that, after all, has been somewhat of a turbulent affair - one that has juxtaposed sporting glory with political scandal, protests, health warnings and multiple sub-plots that have often detracted from the main event itself. 
But even the rain could not stop Rio from bowing out in fashion as a barrage of spectacular fireworks exploded above the stadium to signal the beginning of the end for the 2016 Olympic Games.
