JERUSALEM (AP) - A new poll of Israelis and Palestinians has found that a small majority on both sides still favor a peace settlement establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel, despite years of conflict and deadlocked negotiations. 
The results of the joint poll may provide signs of encouragement when peace prospects appear bleak. The last round of negotiations broke down two years ago, and a resumption of talks seems unlikely. 
Israeli political scientist Tamar Hermann conducted the survey with Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki. Hermann says there&apos;s still some basis for optimism &quot;with the right leadership.&quot; 
The poll released Monday found 51 percent of Palestinians and 59 percent of Israelis still support a two-state solution. The poll surveyed some 1,200 people on each side and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
