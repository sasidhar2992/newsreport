  Check out the 7 best showstoppers in the history of the Great British Bake Off Check out the 7 best showstoppers in the history of the Great British Bake Off 
The Great British Bake Off has seen some truly exceptional showstoppers, with each year’s amateur bakers combining flavours and crafting elaborate designs in their bid to be crowned winner. 
Here are seven of the best: 1. Paul Jagger’s “king of the jungle” lion bread “That is one of the best things I’ve seen in bread ever” @PaulHollywood on The Other Paul’s lion showstopper. #GBBO pic.twitter.com/h53u4fQ6CL 
— BBC One (@BBCOne) August 19, 2015 
“Other Paul” left judge Paul Hollywood almost speechless when he presented his magnificent lion made out of bread. Even the claws were edible almonds, and the whiskers were sprigs of rosemary. 
Paul gave him a firm handshake and called it “one of the best things I’ve seen in bread. Ever.” 2. Nadiya Hussain’s chocolate peacock &quot;Nadiya come through with the peacock girl!&quot;– a real thing I just screamed at the tv. #GBBO is my football pic.twitter.com/hN1IU3gz93 
Paul called Nadiya’s showstopper a “piece of art”, while Mary Berry said it was “really very beautiful”. 
The blue bird had individually-crafted chocolate feathers, and earned her a place in the final. 3. John Whaite’s heaven and hell cake John Whaite (ITV) 
John snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, becoming the surprise winner of the Great British Bake Off when his final showstopper was labelled “perfect” by both judges. 
The 27-step recipe requires 17 cake tins, a blow torch, six straws, five sheets of gold leaf and over 1 kg of sugar. Mum: What birthday cake do you want? &apos;John from GBBO heaven and hell cake&apos; Mum: i&apos;ll make a Vicky Sponge :\ 4. Frances Quinn’s midsummer night’s dream wedding cake Congratulations @frances_quinn a worthy #GBBO winner after baking a spectacular three tier wedding cake pic.twitter.com/jrvRDIOrNn 
— National Baking Week (@bakingweek) October 23, 2013 
The cake was inspired by Shakespeare and involved three “plots”, with different tiers made of ginger, lemon drizzle and a lemon and pineapple top. 
With Limoncello in the icing and a scattering of marzipan bees, fresh fruit, pineapple flowers and edible confetti and petals, Frances put on quite a showstopping performance. 5. Ruby Tandoh’s carrot cake and pistachio garden plot

Contestants were given a difficult task for their showstoppers: construct a themed cake made from vegetables. But Ruby rose to the challenge. 
Using carrot cake, she created an allotment with tiny edible shoots and flowers and poppy seeds for gravel, as well as a chocolate shed with a praline roof. 6. Richard Burr’s pirates . @hellomag #GBBO Richard&apos;s Pirates certainly won our vote. Sail me there any day. pic.twitter.com/0FutT654Mx 
— Love Boat Shows (@LoveBoatShows) August 14, 2014 
Paul thought Richard’s 3D biscuit creation was “genius”, while Mary said it was “melt-in-the-mouth”. 
The showstopper, which won him the title of Star Baker, featured sea creatures and lots of smiley pirates. 7. Victoria Chester’s blackbird hidden in a pie cake “ @BritishBakeOff : Victoria&apos;s showstopping blackbird pie-cake hybrid on last night&apos;s #GBBO . Were you impressed? pic.twitter.com/qt5lPqZx ” 
— Ladybird Cakery (@ladybird_cakery) August 15, 2012 
Asked for “a cake that reveals a hidden design when cut”, Victoria chose a classic in week one when she disguised her bake as the pie from Sing A Song of Sixpence. 
“It tells a story, anybody could guess it,” Mary said, and made her Star Baker. Promoted stories
