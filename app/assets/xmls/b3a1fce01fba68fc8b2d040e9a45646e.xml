At least five rail cars fell into Denton Creek. The Roanoke police department said the incident happened Sunday at 6:00 p.m. in the 3000 block of North Highway 377. It prompted many people to call 911. Twenty-six rail cars derailed in total. A Union Pacific spokesman said the train was traveling from Wyoming to Central Texas at the time of the incident. Part of the bridge collapsed but Union Pacific does not know if the bridge caused the derailment or if the derailment caused the collapse. Cranes may be brought in to clean up the mess. The Roanoke Fire Department said the cars carried coal and not any hazardous materials. Roanoke police expect Highway 377 to be open in the morning. Published at 12:11 AM CDT on Aug 22, 2016
