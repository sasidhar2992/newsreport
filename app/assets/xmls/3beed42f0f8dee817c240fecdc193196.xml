LANSING - A Lansing man has been arraigned on felony charges in connection with the Aug. 18 shooting death of another man on the city&apos;s south side. 
Carl Marshle Price, 23, was arraigned today on two felony charges, open murder and possession of a firearm, in connection with the death of Robert Quinton Wray, Jr., 34, of Lansing, according to a Lansing Police Department news release. 
Wray was found unresponsive in the front yard of a residence in the 6200 block of Grovenburg Road shortly after 9 p.m. Aug. 18, Lansing Police Department Public Information Director Robert Merritt said Friday. Wray died at a local hospital. 
Price was at the scene when police arrived, and police said previously that he was cooperating with the investigation. 
Investigators believe the two men were involved in an altercation or argument Aug. 18 that later escalated to an exchange of gunfire, Merritt told the State Journal Friday. 
Price&apos;s bail was denied. He is scheduled to appear in 54-A District Court on Sept. 1 at 1:15 p.m. in front of Judge Louise Alderson.
