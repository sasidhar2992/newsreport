Renault India has finally launched the powerful version of Kwid hatchback in the country. The car was first unveiled at the 2016 Auto Expo and was much hyped since then. Renault Kwid 1.0 price in India starts at Rs. 3.82 lakhs. The car will be available in two trims RxT and RxT (O) with the latter priced at Rs. 3.95 lakhs (ex-showroom, New Delhi)

Currently, the 5-speed manual will be available with the engine while soon there will be Renault Kwid 1.0-litre AMT on offer as well. At this price point, Renault Kwid 1.0-litre model has best in class power to weight ratio of 97PS/tonne. As far as fuel economy of Kwid 1.0-litre is concerned, it is best in category as well delivering 23.1kmpl (ARAI) 
In terms of aesthetics, the powerful version can be differentiated by the chequered side body graphics engraved with ‘1.0’ and glossy grey finishing on ORVMs. As it will be offered in the top end slot, the car will be available with features like 7-inch MEDIANAV touchscreen infotainment unit, optional driver side airbag, fabric upholstery with red stitching, front power windows and remote central locking.
