<topic_text>
According to the Korea Iron &amp; Steel Association (Kosa), country’s steel market is expected to be improved this year.
Besides, the domestic steel demand is expected to increase by 1.4% because the major business such as construction, automotive and shipbuilding were better than expected since Q1 this year.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s steel output will increase to 3.8% this year and exports will remain stable.
In fact, South Korea’s annual steel export volumes were at 30 million tonnes but imports have less than 20 million tonnes in past four years.
Since the 2008 global financial crisis, South Korea’s steel demand has been weak and it was never returning to the 2008 peak level till now.
