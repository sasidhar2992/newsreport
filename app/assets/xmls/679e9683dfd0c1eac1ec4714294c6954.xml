WASHINGTON -- D.C. United&apos;s Marcelo Sarvas and Patrick Mullins scored three minutes apart in the second half to rally the hosts to a 2-2 draw against New York in Major League Soccer on Sunday, moving into the playoff zone.
The unlikely comeback by MLS&apos; lowest-scoring team coming into the game meant the Red Bulls missed a chance to close in on city rival and Eastern Conference leader New York City, staying four points behind.
New York&apos;s Bradley Wright-Phillips opened the scoring in the 38th minute to become the fourth player in league history to reach 15 goals in three consecutive seasons. Then in the 64th minute Felipe pounded the ball into a small opening just inside the post to put the visitors ahead 2-0.
Sarvas scored his first goal of the season with a penalty in the 70th minute and Mullins also broke through with a header off a corner in the 73rd as D.C. United moved into sixth - the last playoff-yielding spot in the East - equal on points with Orlando City but ahead on better head-to-head record.
Seattle&apos;s Clint Dempsey scored twice and Cristian Roldan added a goal - all in the second half - in the 3-1 victory over Portland.
In front of 53,302 fans at CenturyLink Field, the Sounders won their third straight game and climbed within two points of the Timbers for the last playoff spot in the Western Conference.
Portland got a consolation goal from Fanendo Adi in second-half stoppage time and are still yet to win an away game this season in 13 attempts.
