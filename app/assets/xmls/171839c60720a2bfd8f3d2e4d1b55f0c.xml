Tendulkar to present BMW car to Sindhu Hyderabad, Aug 22, 2016, (PTI): Batting great Sachin Tendulkar will be presenting a BMW car to star shuttler PV Sindhu for bringing laurels to the country by winning a silver medal at the Rio Olympics.

The BMW car is being sponsored by Tendulkar&apos;s close friend and president of Hyderabad Badminton Association of India V Chamundeswaranath.

&quot;Sindhu will be gifted a BMW car by Mr Chamudeswaranath and his friends. Mr Sachin Tendulkar will be presenting the car to Sindhu,&quot; said Punnaiah Choudary, BAI Secretary (Tournaments), who had accompanied the team in Rio.

Four years ago, Tendulkar had present a BMW to ace shuttler Saina Nehwal, who had returned with a bronze medal at the London Olympics.

Tendulakar had also presented a Maruti Swift to Sindhu, who had won the girls&apos; singles title in the Asian Youth Under-19 Championship in 2012.
