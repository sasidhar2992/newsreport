Four-star guard Trent Frazier commits to Illinois Posted: Connect 
CHAMPAIGN -- A week after losing out on Jordan Goodwin, John Groce won big Sunday, landing a verbal commitment from Trent Frazier (Wellington, FL). 
&quot;After this long process me and my family and my high school coach have sat down and made the right decision,&quot; Frazier said on his twitter account. &quot;...These coaches have been recruiting me for two years now and it really means a lot to me. These guys have shown me that I&apos;m their guy and I love it...I will be committing to the University of Illinois&quot;. 
Frazier made his decision after wrapping up an official visit to Illinois this weekend. 
Scout.com ranks the 6&apos;1&quot; point guard as the 74th best overall player, and 15th best point guard in the class of 2017.
