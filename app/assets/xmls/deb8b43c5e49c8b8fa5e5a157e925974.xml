Allied Vision Introduces Mako Models with GigE Vision and USB3 Vision Interface 
Optical data capture of workpieces and automatic adjustment of laser processes eliminate the need for precise workpiece positioning. Machine Vision is also capable of identifying workpieces and workpiece types based on characteristic features, codes or lettering, of analyzing their properties before the laser process and of inspecting the quality of the result afterwards. 
As the White Paper shows, this reduces integration costs while simultaneously increasing the flexibility of manufacturing plants. Industrial cameras and Machine Vision software can be used in combination with laser scanning heads to create reliable, high-precision solutions for even the most challenging of applications. &quot;Machine Vision Control&quot; from RAYLASE uses this approach to implement more efficient and more precise laser processes, thus accelerating time-to-market and minimizing project risk. 
The White Paper is available to download free-of-charge as a PDF: www.raylase.de/fileadmin/downloads/public/Whitepaper-RAYLASE-Machine-Vision-Control-EN.pdf
