Tamara and Sophia, who live in London, arrived in California earlier this month for one of their regular visits to sister Petra Stunt, who is also a mum to daughter Lavinia, three, and twin sons Andrew and James, one. 
It&apos;s also been a typically jet-set summer for Tamara, who only days before jetting to LA had been taking in the sights of Croatia after soaking up the sun in Mykonos. 
Tamara&apos;s husband Jay Rutland has also been back and forth to LA to holiday with his wife and her family.
