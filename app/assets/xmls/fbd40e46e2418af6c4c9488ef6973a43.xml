Mud Hens swept in Columbus Toledo eliminated from playoff contention with loss BLADE STAFF 
COLUMBUS — The Mud Hens’ skid against Columbus continued as the Clippers won 3-1 Sunday to sweep a three-game series. 
With the loss, Toledo was officially elimiated from playoff contention. 
Hens starter Cesar Ramos (0-3) took the loss, allowing two runs on four hits in five innings. He struck out three and walked one. For the most part Ramos kept the Clippers at bay, yielding a solo shot to Columbus’ first baseman Jesus Aguilar in the second inning. 
Toledo answered back in the fifth when third baseman Jordany Valdespin drilled a triple to center. The next batter, shortstop Pedro Ciriaco brought Valdespin in on a sacrifice fly to center. 
The Clippers stormed back in the bottom half of the fifth when shortstop Erik Gonzalez doubled to right-center that brought left fielder Yandy Diaz in from first after Diaz got on base on a fielder’s choice. 
Clippers’ catcher Adam Moore added an insurance run with a home run off Toledo’s Joe Jimenez in the seventh. 
Columbus starter Adam Plutko (6-4) went six innings while giving up one run on six hits and five strikeouts. Related Items:
