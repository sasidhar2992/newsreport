MOSCOW (AP) — Ukrainian authorities say a Russian activist has requested political asylum in their country. 
Ukraine&apos;s State Border Guard Service said in a statement on Sunday that a Russian citizen requested political asylum at a border crossing in western Ukraine, citing his activism in Russia. The agency described the man as a political activist who had protested against Kremlin policies. 
Ukraine&apos;s Hromadske television late Sunday identified the man as Roman Roslovtsev who is better known for his walks across Red Square in a President Vladimir Putin mask. He has been detained more than 20 times and served 20 days in police custody in May for one of his protest walks. 
Since Russia&apos;s annexation of Crimea in 2014 a number of Russian activists have moved to Ukraine to protest Putin&apos;s policies.
