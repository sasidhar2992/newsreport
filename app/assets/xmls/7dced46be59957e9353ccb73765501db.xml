SINGAPORE - Best World International, LionGold Corp and Broadway Industrial Group were queried by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) on Monday (Aug 22) for unusual movements in the trading of their shares. 
Best World, a direct-selling company that deals with a wide range of healthcare product, was queried for &quot;unusual price movements&quot;. Earlier this month, the direct-selling company of skincare and healthcare products, posted a 273 per cent jump in net profit to S$7.37 million. The company has also recently received in-principle approval for its one-for-four bonus issue. The counter was up 5 per cent at S$1.77, with 2.13 million shares traded, as of 12:45 pm. 
Broadway Industrial and LionGold were queried for &quot;unusual volume movements&quot; in the trading of their shares. 
Broadway requested for a trading halt at about 12:02 pm &quot;pending release of an announcement&quot; just before SGX posted its query, after its stock jumped 23 per cent to 16.6 cents with 2.07 million shares traded. 
LionGold was unchanged at 0.1 cent but it was the most active counter with a whopping 466.9 million shares trades asof 2:30 pm. Mr Md Wira Dani Abdul Daim, the son of Malaysia&apos;s former finance minister Daim Zainuddin, resigned last week as a non-independent and non-executive director of LionGold after he was made a bankrupt in Singapore over some S$1.65 million he owed to Maybank Kim Eng Securities.
