San Francisco: According to the reports, the Apple Store is much more than a store, and that’s probably why Apple decided to drop the “Store” from the name. The company issued a memo to its retail employees, stating that the name change is a gradual one and starts with new stores, though you’ll notice that the Apple Retail Store List has already implemented the change. 
Now it’s just “Apple,” plus the name of the location to differentiate each store. For example, in Orlando, Florida, the two Apple stores are known as Apple Florida Mall and Apple Millenia. The name change seems to have been initiated with the opening of the Apple Union Square store in San Francisco in May 2016. That store—referred to as “Apple Union Square” throughout a press release that doesn’t use the “Apple Store” terminology—features new store sections such as The Forum, where training programs and presentations are held, and The Plaza, an outdoor public area that’s always open, equipped with free Wi-Fi, and features musical performances.
