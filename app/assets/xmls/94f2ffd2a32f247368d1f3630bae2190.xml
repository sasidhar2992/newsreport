China for the first time joined the world’s top 25 most-innovative economies, according to a report by Cornell University, INSEAD and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). China ranked 25th in the Global Innovation Index, up from 29th in last year’s ranking. It is also the first time that a middle-income country has joined the club of the top 25 most-innovative economies, which had been dominated by highly-developed economies. Switzerland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and Finland are the top five innovation performers worldwide, said the study, which scored each country based on 82 indicators. Soumitra Dutta, Dean of Cornell College of Business and co-editor of the report, said in a statement: “Investing in improving innovation quality is essential for closing the innovation divide. Economies need to focus on reforming education and growing their research capabilities to compete successfully in a rapidly changing globalized world”. Japan, the U.S., the UK and Germany are the top four countries in order of “innovation quality”, which is the most critical indicator, that looks at the caliber of universities, the number of scientific publications and international patent filings. China this year climbed to 17th place in innovation quality, making it the leader among all middle-income economies for this indicator, the China Daily reports.
