Powerful pills found at the mansion of pop star Prince were mislabelled, investigators have said.

Prince passed away in April and post-mortem tests later revealed he had died from fentanyl, a powerful painkiller. Prince died from an overdose of fentanyl 
The star is not thought to have had prescriptions for any controlled substances in the state of Minnesota in the 12 months before he died at the age of 57. 
Authorities are still investigating how Prince obtained the drugs. Read More 
The Minneapolis Star Tribune said: &quot;It seems more and more likely that Prince became a casualty of what is being called a new national crisis of deadly counterfeit pills.&quot; Getty Images Singer Prince performs onstage during the 2007 NCLR ALMA Awards Getty Prince 
A spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) added to the publication that officials &quot;haven&apos;t assigned a time limit&quot; on their investigation and said it would be &quot;ongoing and thorough.&quot; 
Prince was found dead in a lift at his home in Minnesota on April 21. 
His death occurred just one week after his private plane made an emergency landing in Illinois after he fell ill.
