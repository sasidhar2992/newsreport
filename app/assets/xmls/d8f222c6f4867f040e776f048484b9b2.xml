Fiji Seven&apos;s victory about more than just team 
Monday 22 Aug 2016 7:41 p.m. By Ryan Bridge 
There is no doubt we are very proud and excited about New Zealand&apos;s Olympic success. But can you imagine turning up that excitement and turbo charging it too? 
That should give you an idea of how they must be feeling in Fiji and the Olympic gold homecoming of the Fiji Sevens team. 
The players and coach Ben Ryan told us they were giving it their all, not because they love the sport, but because they want Fiji to be inspired and not just about rugby. 
Story is in Nadi with the story behind the team&apos;s victory and the people it&apos;s changed the most.
