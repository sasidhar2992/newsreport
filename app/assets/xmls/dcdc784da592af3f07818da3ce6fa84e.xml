<topic_text>
Since he famously skippered the wing-keeled Australia II to victory in the 1983 America’s Cup, breaking 132 years of American dominance, John Bertrand has become one of the country’s most admired leaders. In business he has built companies in the marine industry, property development and digital media. He is chairman and president of Swimming Australia Alannah and Madeline Foundation. When did you first realise you were successful? I’m still trying to prove it – but clearly the America’s Cup. No one had achieved that before. The America’s Cup started before the US Civil War, to put it in context, and no other nation had been able to win it until we put a program together to beat the Americans. Secrets for success?
