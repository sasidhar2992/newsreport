Britain&apos;s Lynsey Sharp has reignited the row over controversial South African runner Caster Semenya by admitting it was &apos;difficult&apos; to race against her. 
Sharp, 26, finished sixth in the 800m final while Semenya – who was once forced to undergo humiliating gender testing to prove she was female – took gold, setting a new national record. 
After the race Sharp told the BBC: &apos;I have tried to avoid the issue all year. You can see how emotional it all was. We know how each other feels. It is out of our control and how much we rely on people at the top sorting it out. 
&apos;The public can see how difficult it is with the change of rule but all we can do is give it our best.&apos; 
Sharp, who has previously complained Semenya&apos;s condition resulted in &apos;two separate races&apos; made her latest comments in an tearful interview after Saturday&apos;s final

Semenya, 25, has an &apos;intersex&apos; condition called hyperandrogenism which results in her having testosterone levels that are three times those usually found in women and approaching those of a man. 
Sharp faced a furious backlash over her [email protected] wrote on Twitter: Dear Lynsey Sharp, You can&apos;t be mediocre your whole life. Be better. Sincerely yours, South Africa&apos;

Semenya was once forced to take medicine to suppress her testosterone amid claims she had an unfair advantage. 
But the rules have been challenged meaning she can now run without the medication. 
Silver medallist Francine Niyonsaba and Margaret Wambui, who got a bronze, have also faced questions about their testosterone levels. 
South African fans were quick to criticise was they saw to be Sharp&apos;s &apos;sour grapes&apos; in losing to Caster Semenya

Sharp, who ran a personal best 1min 57.69secs, hinted that her feelings are shared by fellow athletes Melissa Bishop of Canada and Poland&apos;s Joanna Jozwik, who also missed out on medals. 
The three embraced after the race in what Sharp said was a show of unity, adding: &apos;We see each other week in, week out, so we know how each other feels.&apos; 
Sharp, who wrote a dissertation on hyperandrogenism while studying law at Napier University, later tweeted: &apos;I have tremendous respect for Caster. When asked on live TV, I felt I gave an honest and diplomatic response.&apos; 
When Semenya first emerged on the scene she was forced to have gender testing and subjected to cruel comments about her appearance. She has no womb or ovaries and instead, due to a chromosomal abnormality, internal testes. 
Semenya spent 11 months on the sidelines while she had tests but was cleared to compete in 2010. 
By this time the International Association of Athletics Federations had set a testosterone threshold. It meant Semenya could run again if she took medicine to suppress her testosterone levels. 
The ruling was then challenged by Indian runner Dutee Chand, who also has hyperandrogenism. 
In 2015, the Court of Arbitration for Sport suspended the rules for two years, meaning Semenya could come off the medication. 
Critics agree the way she has been treated has shamed the sport, and harks back to 1966 when female competitors at the European Athletics Championship were subjected to a &apos;nude parade&apos; past three gynaecologists. 
Semenya has previously said: &apos;I think sports are meant to unite people. It&apos;s not about being more muscular, it&apos;s all about sport.&apos; Most watched News videos Share Or Comment On This Article Disclaimer : Opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of Capitalbay.
