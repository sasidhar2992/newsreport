St Kilda schoolgirl Izzi Dymalovski launched her own skincare range at 13 and became the youngest-ever entrepreneur to appear on Channel Ten’s business reality show Shark Tank . 
What’s the buzz? 
The St Michael’s Grammar School student, now 14, wowed Australia’s leading business talent with a pitch for investment in her Luv Ur Skin range. While the 
Shark Tank team determined Izzi was too young to compromise her schooling by furthering the business, recruitment guru Andrew Banks described her as “just remarkable” while Boost Juice founder Janine Allis offered her an internship. 
In the beginning … 
At age eight Izzi wanted to use some of her mum Sonja’s products to clean her skin of make-up after a dance concert. Sonja said adult products contained too many chemicals and that Izzi would have to use baby products. When Izzi replied that she wasn’t a baby, Sonja, who works in biotech, suggested she could make her own skin-care potions and put Izzi in touch with a chemist friend who helped her formulate her first face wash, face moisturiser, body wash and body lotion. 
The big break … 
After Izzi took her products to school for friends to try she realised there was a market. Over the next few years she was hands-on developing the brand, designing the logo and packaging, and began selling online 18 months ago. In March she became the youngest-ever supplier contracted to Priceline. 
Where to now? 
Izzi is now looking to distribute Luv Ur Skin in Europe and the US. But in the long-term she has her eyes set on Broadway. “I love musical theatre. I just got cast in my school’s year 7-9 musical and I do a few local productions.” 
The best part of success? 
“ Shark Tank was definitely a highlight and I got to choose dinner the night it aired,” Izzi says. “But I think being one of the youngest people to ever get their products in Priceline was incredible.” 
If I could do it all again? 
“I don’t think I would change anything because even every mistake I have made has led to the success I am experiencing now.”
