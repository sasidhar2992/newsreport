BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Police are seeking at least two suspects in a shooting at a crowded Connecticut house party that left 13 people wounded.
Bridgeport police say they believe the shooters were hiding behind bushes alongside the house, and while the party was going on early Sunday morning, opened fire on more than 100 people.
Most of the victims suffered gunshot wounds to their legs. By Sunday afternoon, only five remained hospitalized.
Police say the people who threw the party had gone to the police department at one point to try to apply for a permit to sell alcohol, which was denied.
Police say they believe they charged for alcohol anyway, and could face criminal charges.
A motive for the shooting remains unclear. Police are investigating whether the suspects were partygoers.
