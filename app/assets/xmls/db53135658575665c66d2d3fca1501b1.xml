In a lot of ways, Final Fantasy XV resembles a typical fantasy epic. You have a band of warriors, led by a brooding prince, traveling the world on a lengthy quest. There’s a serious king doing everything he can to keep his people safe amongst the violent drama of warring factions. But it’s also really, really weird, with trailers that focus on everything from camping trips to luxury cars (that can also transform into planes) to shopping in a convenience store.
This mixture of goofy and serious is on full display in the ongoing anime spinoff, Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV, the fourth episode of which was released just this week. It’s delightfully strange, and the perfect thing to hold you over until the game’s November release.
