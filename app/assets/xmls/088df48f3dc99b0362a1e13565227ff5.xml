Showers &amp; storms likely today, then relief arrives Showers &amp; storms likely today, then relief arrives Published 8:42 AM EDT Aug 21, 2016 
An approaching cold front is leading to increasing clouds this morning, and even a few showers around the region as well. Related A few storms today, then humidity... 
Rain and thunderstorms chances will rise quickly through day today, and scattered to numerous showers &amp; thunderstorms are likely for many Susquehanna Valley locations this afternoon and evening. Some of the storms may become severe by producing heavy rain and gusty winds. Highs will reach the mid-80s with high humidity. While there are chances for rain this morning, the greatest chance for these storms will be between 2 pm and 7 pm. Widespread rainfall totals will range between 1/4&quot; to 3/4&quot; of an inch of rain, but some spots could see more than 1&quot; of rain fall during the afternoon and evening. 
Behind the front, we&apos;ll see clearing Sunday night into Monday morning with BIG relief surging into the region in the form of cooler temps and much lower humidity levels. 
Highs will stay near 80 under sunny skies Monday through Wednesday, with lows in the upper 50s. This will be the most comfortable stretch of weather we&apos;ve experienced in MONTHS! Enjoy! 
Today: Mostly cloudy. Isolated t&apos;showers possible this morning. Afternoon/evening thunderstorms are likely. Some storms may produce heavy rain, gusty winds. Humid. High: 84. Winds: SSE 5-15 mph. 
Tonight: Clearing skies. Turning less humid &amp; more comfortable. Low: 64. Winds: SE to NW 5-10 mph. 
Monday : Mostly sunny. Breezy &amp; pleasant with much lower humidity levels. Highs: Near 80. Winds: NW 10-15 mph. 
Tuesday: Sunny &amp; comfortable. High: 80. Winds: NNE 5-10 mph.
