Tougher Emissions Rules for 18-Wheelers August 22. 2016 Tens of thousands of Granite Staters could soon be breathing easier because of new emissions standards just set for the trucking industry. (P.A. LeClercq) 
CONCORD, N.H. — Big rigs on the interstate in New Hampshire and around the country could soon be spewing less harmful emissions. The Obama administration released new carbon-emission standards that will require a reduction of up to 25 percent for trucks and buses over the next 10 years. According to Mike Seilback, a vice president for advocacy with the American Lung Association of the Northeast, the change should mean better health for many in New Hampshire. &quot;For the tens of thousands of New Hampshire residents that struggle with things like asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease and diabetes,” Seilback said, &quot;this announcement&apos;s going to directly impact their lives by giving them cleaner air to breathe.&quot; In addition to health benefits in the region, Seilback said the economy in New England could also see a bump; although the trucking industry has expressed concerns about the costs associated with the change. Paul Billings, also with the American Lung Association, said semi-trucks are often on the road for at least 10 years, and cover a million miles during that time. He predicted the new emission standards could have a long-term impact on the country&apos;s air quality. &quot;The thing about trucks is, they last a long time, and so it takes a long time for new technology to come in and replace the older trucks as they retire,” Billings said. &quot;But this is a forward-looking rule, so we&apos;ll continue to see benefits as these cleaner, more efficient vehicles replace the older, less efficient vehicles.&quot; The Obama administration estimated the new rules would cut more than 1 billion metric tons of carbon emissions by 2027, and save the trucking industry $170 billion in fuel costs - reducing petroleum use by two billion barrels over the lifetime of the vehicles sold under the new rules.
