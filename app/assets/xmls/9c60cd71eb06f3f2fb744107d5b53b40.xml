BALTIMORE (AP) - Dallas Keuchel was solid through eight innings, Yulieski Gurriel got a hit in his major league debut and the Houston Astros beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-3 in a rain-delayed victory Sunday. 
The Astros won the last three games in the four-game series, outscoring Baltimore 32-13 over that stretch. The slumping Orioles have lost four of five and are 9-16 over their past 25 games. 
Keuchel (8-12), last year&apos;s Cy Young Award winner, allowed two runs and five hits with seven strikeouts. Ken Giles picked up his third save despite allowing Mark Trumbo to hit his league-leading 37th home run. 
Baltimore&apos;s Yovani Gallardo (4-5) allowed four runs and seven hits over a season-tying high seven innings. 
The start of the game was delayed for 4 hours, 5 minutes because of storms. Another downpour at the end of the first inning prompted an additional 30-minute interruption. 
Jake Marisnick homered for Houston, and Carlos Correa went 2 for 3 with two RBIs.
