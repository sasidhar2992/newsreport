Print This DC United players in the pool. Division Two side DC United took to the swimming pool to undertake water therapy to cure minor injuries. The Sunyani-based side drew a bye this weekend in the Brong Ahafo Division Two League Zone 1A, and this did not make their off day go waste. The move which could be seen as a local version of cryotherapy is meant to refresh the players. Courtesy of GHANAsoccernet.com - Ghana&apos;s leading football news website. Click for more news.
