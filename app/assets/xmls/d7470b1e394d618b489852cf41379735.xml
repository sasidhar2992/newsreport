UFC Prez Dana White Nixes McGregor &amp; Diaz Trilogy UFC Prez Dana White Nixes McGregor &amp; Diaz Trilogy ... &quot;I&apos;m Movin&apos; On&quot; 8/22/2016 1:00 AM PDT BY TMZ STAFF EXCLUSIVE 
It&apos;s as shocking as Saturday night&apos;s fight was awesome ... there will be no Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz trilogy ... according to the man who makes the decision. 
Dana White tells TMZ Sports he wants Conor to defend his title against in room champ Jose Aldo . Dana says, &quot;The war was fun and super successful but I&apos;m moving on.&quot; Here&apos;s the rub -- Conor beefed up for his fight against the much larger Diaz. Conor normally fights at 145 and swelled to 168 ... but Diaz weighed in at 170. 
Dana says Conor has two options -- either fight Aldo and surrender his title to him -- or cut weight to 155 and fight Danny Martinez for the Flyweight title. 
Dana says under any scenario, he&apos;s closing the books on McGregor vs. Diaz.
