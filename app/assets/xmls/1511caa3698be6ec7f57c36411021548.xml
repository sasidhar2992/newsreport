Bishop Obinim REVEALS The Age He Had Sex And Who He Had Sex With August 22, 2016 Google + 
Controversial man of God and founder of the International God’s Way Church, Bishop Daniel Obinim says he had wanted the teenagers he flogged to follow his footsteps as a “virgin”. 
According to him – he was pure and vestal modesty as a youngster so finds it immoral for children under his care to engage in sexual activities. ‘Angel’ Obinim sparked another controversy after he was captured in a video flogging teenagers he accused of sleeping around. 
The video that has gone viral on social media has been condemned by many – but furious Obinim did not understand why Illiasu, who according to him is sixteen (16) years (biological father has passed on) and was still in school and being looked after by him (Obinim), would have sex with an equally young girl, Gyasiwaa, 14 who is learning a vocation. 
Speaking to Kwesi Aboagye on Neat FM’s ‘Ghana Montie’ programme, Bishop Obinim said he is against premature sex. “I have biological kids and won’t allow them to engage in sex at a tender age. So why should I allow others kids too? 
Despite my immorality as a pastor, I never engaged in sex when I was young. I was a virgin from age one [1] till twenty-seven [27]. I never had sex,until i married, I was a virgin so I want to inculcate that in my kids,” he said. –
