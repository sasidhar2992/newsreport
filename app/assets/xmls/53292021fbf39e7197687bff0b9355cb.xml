Actress Nargis Fakhri, who is currently in New York preparing for a Hollywood film, says reading “Robinson Crusoe” was her first tryst with the “magical experience” of world travel — so much so that she has become a travel junkie herself. 
“Growing up, I would find myself attracted to the genre of castaway novels and travelogues when I would go to the public library to catch up on my reading. And ironically enough, my first tryst with the magical experience of world travel was with Daniel Defoe’s ‘Robinson Crusoe’,” Nargis said in a statement. 
The story of “Robinson Crusoe”, is set to be showcased in 3D animation on the big screen on September 9 by PVR Pictures. 
Further about her fascination with the tale, Nargis said: “Reading about a sailor’s effort to get back to his world after being shipwrecked and marooned on a tropical island filled with animals, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers was so exciting. 
“I literally wanted to take off and see this island in person and see it for how it was described. It’s that day and now, that I am and continue to be intrigued by the idea of exploring the world and experiencing all it has to offer. I’m so glad I can share my ‘Robinson Crusoe’ experience with everyone through this film and more so in 3D animation.” IANS
