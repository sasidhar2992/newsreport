  For the better part of the year, John Oliver has built his show on the solid orange foundation that is Donald Trump, but his concerned piss-takes have always appealed to the better nature of America&apos;s voting public. Today, Oliver went one better. He finally delivered an address directly to the Republican Presidential nominee himself.Your favourite shouty, British , liberal talk show host essentially nominated himself as the leader of Trump&apos;s farting corpse of a campaign, and why wouldn&apos;t he - Trump&apos;s team has just installed a legitimate conspiracy-monger as its top dog, so you&apos;d think Oliver could have a tilt.His first order of business? Convincing Trump to drop out, in a way that&apos;d still make the man look like a bona fide winner. In a segment that makes a worrying amount of sense, Oliver posits that Trump&apos;s campaign would prove its worth, if the nominee played it off like some ungodly critique of the US political system. &quot;Just think about how triumphant it would feel to say on national television &apos;I openly ran on a platform of impossibly ignorant proposals steeped in racial bigotry and nobody stopped me. In fact, you embraced me for it. What the fuck was that about?&apos; That would be one of the most powerful political speeches of all time. I&apos;m telling you, if you drop out in order to teach America a lesson, you would not be a loser. You would be a legend.&quot; Then, because HBO has the budget to do so, Oliver unveiled the literal platform his show is willing to provide Trump in order to deliver that concession speech. Your move, Donathon:
