The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Monday backed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat&apos;s assertion on the Hindu population and said all political leaders should take initiatives in order to control the rising population.
NCP leader Tariq Anwar told ANI that Bhagwat has said the right thing, adding there is no restriction in India with regard to producing children.
&quot;But it is not in favour of the nation.be it the Hindus or the Muslims or any community. The problem of population is the biggest in India. In order to control the population, all the political leaders should take initiatives,&quot; he added.
Resonating similar sentiments, another NCP leader Majeed Memon said one should not convey a message, which tends to go down to the people that Bhagwat&apos;s appeal to produce more Hindu children is with a certain motivation that we should outnumber Muslims or others or become more strong to fight against them.
&quot;If that is not the motive, then I welcome the statement. Every Hindu has a right to produce as many as children as he can because the law does not expressly forbids such an act,&quot; he added.
Addressing around 2,000 young couples at a function in Agra on Saturday, 65-year-old Bhagwat urged them to work for family values and help inculcate patriotic sentiments in the children.
&quot;Which law says that the population of Hindus should not rise? What is stopping them when population of others is rising? The issue is not related to the system. It is because the social environment is like this,&quot; he said.
