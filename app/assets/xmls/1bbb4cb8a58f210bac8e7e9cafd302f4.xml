A naked suicidal woman jumped from the window of an apartment – but was saved when she landed on an air conditioning unit two stories below. 
The woman, who has not been named, jumped out of the window of a building in Marble Hill in The Bronx, New York, on Saturday morning. 
Officers from the Emergency Service Unit managed to convince the woman not to take her life and pulled her back inside, the New York Post reports.

She tried to fight them off, but they managed to get her inside, clothed her and then carried her out on a stretcher. 
The woman was taken to North Central Bronx Hospital, where she will have a psychiatric evaluation. 
She won’t be facing any criminal charges, a police source told the Post. 
One witness said the woman’s mother had been holding on to her, but lost her grip and she fell.

When she landed on the air conditioner, she sat on it and began screaming in English and Spanish to passers-by. 
‘She was saying that God is coming and everybody has to be better people, and we have to love each other,’ Dahiana Rosario told the Post. 
‘She was saying God loves us – and God loves everybody and clean your house of bad things, bad energy.’ 
Neighbors called authorities and had placed pillows and sofas underneath the air conditioner in case the woman jumped again.
