Here&apos;s what happens to your body if you eat an avocado pit By The Rainbow Previous | Next 
Avocados have been in the news lately. After all, avocado toast is the brunch item de jour. And guacamole? Yum . 
But there&apos;s a nasty rumor following our favorite fruit: that the avocado pit is poisonous. Yikes. So we decided to investigate. 
giphy.comAs Poppy Ellard writes for Spoon U : “Camps are divided on whether or not [avocado pits] actually a superfood or a super way to go to the hospital. The answer is yes and no , but mostly no.” 
Here&apos;s the thing: while there is a slight amount of persin , a fungicidal toxin similar to a fatty acid, in avocado pits, there is only a very small amount . For the seed to be poisonous, you&apos;d have to eat massive quantities . 
And while avocados are tasty, their pits aren&apos;t exactly a delicacy. While people do use the pits to create a powder that can then be added to smoothies and other beverages, the small amount is not going to make humans sick. Plus, avocado pits are filled with antioxidants and fiber , making them great for your body and skin . Just eat a small amount, and you&apos;ll be fine. 
giphy.com While some sites claim that avocado pits can be toxic to animals such as our feline friends and canine companions, the #truth of this claim is highly debated. 
Most claim they&apos;re not actually that harmful. Persin is, however, extremely poisonous for birds and large animals, so don&apos;t go feeding your pet horse an avocado pit. 
Now go enjoy some delicious avocado toast!
