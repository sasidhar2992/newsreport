This entry was posted in sports Tweet unfair Caster Semenya A french runner who failed to qualify during the 800m heat at the Rio Olympics has questioned the fairness of Caster Semenya competing professionally. 
Justin Fedronic has brought up Semenya being allowed to compete amongst other female runners, saying it was unfair on the other runners to go up against her. 
“When you line up against someone like that, you know it’s going to be a completely different ball game. I do feel for her. She is just trying to train and compete just like the rest of us, so that is really not fair to her. But it is not fair for others too. So I don’t know what the solution is,” she told Reuters. unfair Caster Semenya 
Semenya came first place during her heat with a time of 1.59.31. She is expected to win gold on Saturday during the finals and is a firm favourite. 
About the race, the 25-year old said it was tougher than it looked. 
“It wasn’t easy, It was pretty hot. I just tried to hang on and tried to feel my body first so I was comfortable,” she said. 
Semenya has had to contend with media scrutiny after she clinched the world title in 2009. Her win caused an uproar with a demand for her to be tested. While her results were never made public, there were leaks revealing she had higher amounts of testosterone being produced in her body. 
The Court of Arbitration for Sport overruled a decision by the International Association of Athletics Federations , 
(IAAF) limiting the amount of naturally occurring functional testosterone for female athlete. This cleared Semenya to compete professionally.
