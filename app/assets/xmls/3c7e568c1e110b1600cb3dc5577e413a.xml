OTA 
A California hotel operator has filed suit against against Expedia, alleging that the OTA buys search and social media advertising for properties not listed on its sites and then attempts to get interested customers to book with one of its partner hotels instead. 
The proposed class action suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Northern California, accuses Expedia off false advertising, unfair competition, and “bait and switch” tactics. The complaint was filed by the operator of the Buckeye Tree Lodge and Sequoia Village Inn in Three Rivers, Calif., outside of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park. An Expedia spokesperson told GeekWire, “We value our relationships with hoteliers and take allegations such as these seriously. We are investigating the allegations and whether our standard practices were followed. However, the value of our marketplace as a fair and effective way to connect hoteliers and travelers is our number one priority.” The complaint says Expedia, which is headquartered in Bellevue, Wash., lures customers with online deals for hotels that are not bookable through Expedia.com or its other sites. When a customer clicks these deals and tries to make a reservation through Expedia, the site says there is no vacancy and suggests alternative hotels in the area, the complaint alleges.
