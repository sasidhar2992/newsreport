GETTY BID: Liverpool have offered £4.3m for Bruno Martins Indi 
The Holland international can play at centre-back and left-back and his versatility is reported to be attractive to Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp . 
The Reds have struggled with injuries at the back during pre-season while left-back Alberto Moreno has come in for heavy criticism following his performance against Arsenal last weekend. 
Turkish outlet Fanatik claim Liverpool have made a £4.3m opening bid for the 24-year-old. “Will I (spend money)? The answer is I don’t know. We will see” Jurgen Klopp 
However, Porto are said to want £6m while Liverpool could face competition from Turkish champions Besiktas. 
Martins Indi has been capped 31 times by Holland and joined Porto in 2014 after impressive performances at the 2014 World Cup. 
Liverpool are short of options in defence with Joe Gomez and Mamadou Sakho both sidelined with Achilles injuries while Joel Matip missed much of pre-season with an ankle injury, although he is available for selection again. 
Klopp had been keen to sign a new left-back but failed in his attempts to bring in Ben Chilwell from Leicester. Related videos
