A team of Chinese investors have voiced their willingness to invest in Iran’s steel industry, a senior Iranian trade official announced.
“The Chinese investors have said that they want to invest in the construction of steel products and ingot plans in Kermanshah province,” Head of Kermanshah Province’s Chamber of Commerce Keyvan Kashefi said.
He said provincial officials are pursuing finance for the development projects in Kermanshah province, and the number of visits by foreign investors to Kermanshah province has, thus, risen.
On Monday, Managing Director of Bank of Industry and Mine (BIM) Ali Ashraf Afkhami underlined that Iran’s lucrative market and eye-catching economic opportunities have persuaded Chinese investors to try to increase their investments in the country’s development projects.
In a meeting between the head of a high-ranking Chinese delegation from National Machinery Industry Corporation (SINOMACH) and Afkhami, the two officials discussed ways for broadening of cooperation in various fields, mainly investment in Iran’s projects by the Chinese side.
Trade between Iran and China in the past year was estimated at $45bln.
Iran is currently China’s third largest supplier of crude, providing Beijing with roughly 12 percent of its total annual oil consumption.
According to the figures released by China’s General Administration of Customs in January, China’s crude oil imports from Iran reached 2.5mln tons (mt) in December 2012, up 43 percent from November.
The official data showed that China’s daily crude imports from Iran in December 2012 also rose 3.6 percent compared to December 2011.
It marks China’s biggest crude import from Iran since it won a renewal of exemption from the United States’ oil embargo against Iran.
