Frisco ISD officials are expecting more than 56,000 students in 68 schools. (Published Sunday, Aug. 21, 2016) Frisco ISD is the fastest growing school district in Texas. Four new schools will open on Monday and 600 new teachers were hired over the summer. Frisco ISD officials are expecting more than 56,000 students in 68 schools. Last year, Frisco ISD had 5,753 students who qualified for free or reduced lunch. The number made up nearly 11% of FISD&apos;s 53,301 students in 2015-2016. This may surprise people in a community where the median income is $115,000 according to the city of Frisco. &quot;I&apos;ve always said poverty is a complex issue, but feeding hungry kids is not,&quot; said Frisco Fastpacs founder Marian Schulze. &quot;There are 700 kids that we serve, but there are actually more children who need help.&quot; Schulze started Frisco Fastpacs in 2013 after fasting during Lent. During that time, Schulze developed a deep empathy for local children who experienced hunger on a regular basis. &quot;I had the misconception [Frisco ISD students come from affluent families]. I&apos;m a big believer when you know better, you do better,&quot; Schulze said. &quot;I didn&apos;t know any better, but once I discovered the need was right here in Frisco, it became a game changer for me.&quot; Frisco Fastpacs hosts a food drive three times a year. The non-profit group relies on donations from the community. Over the weekend, Frisco Fastpacs collected hundreds of pounds of food that will be sorted and delivered to more than 700 low income students at 33 schools. One bag is equivalent to seven meals for a weekend. &quot;Dinner Friday night. Breakfast, lunch and dinner for Saturday and Sunday,&quot; said Frisco Fastpacs Executive Director Heather Canterbury. &quot;They (student&apos;s family) sign up for free and reduced lunch, and the counselors let them know our program is available to them as well.&quot; More information on how to donate or volunteer, can be found on the Frisco Fastpacs website.
