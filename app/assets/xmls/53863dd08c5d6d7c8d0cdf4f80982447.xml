Stonewall hosts Labor Day weekend celebration August 22, 2016 Save | Post a comment | 
WESTON - Celebrate the end of summer with a weekend full of recreation, music, food and family fun, including a fireworks display Sunday, Sept. 4, to cap off a great Labor Day holiday at Stonewall Resort. 
Stonewall Resort director of operations Richard Ebright said, &quot;We have put together a great schedule of activities and entertainment this Labor Day weekend. These events are open to all day visitors and resort guests. The weekend culminates in a fabulous fireworks show over Stonewall Jackson Lake on Sunday night.&quot; 
On Friday, Sept. 2, The Fearless Fools - West Virginia&apos;s most hilarious comedy troupe will perform a special comedy fusion show at 8 p.m. This performance will include sketch comedy, improvisation (akin to the &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; TV show), interactive games and more. A cash bar will be available with admission. 
Family fun is a cornerstone of any visit to Stonewall and Labor Day Weekend takes it to a new level. A multitude of activities are on tap for the weekend and include relaxing lake cruises on Stonewall Jackson Lake, evening outdoor movies, hayrides, and family craft making. Lawn games, like archery tag, corn hole, volleyball, badminton and ladder ball, will be offered throughout the day. Guests may also rent kayaks, paddleboards, bikes and engage in a plethora of other fun activities. 
The resort will offer what may be its largest weekend lineup of musical acts ever. Artists scheduled to perform include: Dustin McCray, DJ Dick Harrison, Samantha Fox &amp; The Hound Dogs and John Henry. Beginning at 7 p.m. on Saturday night, Sept. 3, The Marshall Lowry Band will perform on the Roanoke Activity Plaza Lawn as part of the resort&apos;s Summer Concert Series. This event is sponsored by Dominion Resources. 
Guests will be treated to a spectacular fireworks display over Stonewall Jackson Lake Sunday evening, Sept. 4, at dark. There is a per-car admission fee to enter the park. 
On Labor Day, Sept. 5, Stonewall Resort will host Patriot Golf Day, an initiative benefitting the Folds of Honor Foundation and featuring a public golf tournament. This four-player scramble event has an 8:30 a.m. shotgun start and offers over $16,000 in total prizes, including a $5,000 hole-in-one contest on hole No. 2. A portion of the entry fee will support postsecondary educational scholarships for children and spouses of military service men and women killed or disabled while serving our nation. To learn more, or to register, contact the Golf Shop, at 304-269-8885. 
&quot;Whether you&apos;re a golfer, a boater or just want to relax and enjoy the serenity of nature, come celebrate the traditions of Labor Day Weekend at Stonewall Resort,&quot; Ebright said.
