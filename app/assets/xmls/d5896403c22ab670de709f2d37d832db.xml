  Volkswagen Malaysia is Official Partner for Upcoming ‘KL Wangan’ Movie by Pekin Ibrahim 
Volkswagen Malaysia and Centro Pictures has signed a partnership agreement that sees Volkswagen becoming an official sponsor of Centro Pictures’ upcoming street racing movie, ‘KL Wangan’. The agreement was signed during a ceremony held at Volkswagen Gombak last week. 
A historical milestone that marks the first time an international car marquee is supporting a local film production here in Malaysia, the collaboration represents a unique way for Volkswagen to showcase the performance, reliability and distinct design of its products. 
‘KL Wangan’, which roughly translates to KL midnight race, promises to be packed with high speed car chases and thrills. The film is directed by talented actor, Pekin Ibrahim and will showcase some of Volkswagen’s most iconic models – the high-performance Golf R, the Golf GTI, the much-loved Beetle, and the soon-to- be launched all-new Passat. 
Pekin, himself is a Volkswagen owner and enthusiast, will also star in the movie, alongside actors Faizal Hussein, Jasmine Suraya, Kazuto, Emily Lin and Farouk. Production began on 21 st August, with filming scheduled to take place around big cities and iconic landmarks in Malaysia.
