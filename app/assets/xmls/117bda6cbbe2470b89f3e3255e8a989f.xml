Boy Scout Troop 101 of First Baptist in Shelby has a long-standing tradition of excellence at their week-long summer camp out at Camp Bud Schiele. 
Each year, Boy Scout troops from all over the Carolinas come together to improve their skills, grow in scouting, and compete against each other in a day long adventure. 
This year marks the eighth year in a row that Troop 101 has competed and won, earning the title “Best of Bud Schiele.” 
The troop was led to success by senior patrol leader Will Blankenship and assistant senior patrol leader Michael Hess. 
Troop 101 scored 397.9 points out of a possible 400 points, placing in all 13 events. 
The troop received first place ribbons in the canoe race, catapult, bear bagging, knot tying, a water relay, a marathon relay, identifying the Scout 10 essentials, first-aid, an obstacle course, and a cook-off. 
Second place ribbons were earned in the scoutmaster’s cobbler cook-off, and an amphibious car race using a car that could go from land to water which the scouts designed and built themselves. 
“These boys deserve a lot of credit for all that they’ve accomplished at summer camp this year,&quot; said Scoutmaster Billy Costello. &quot;They trained hard in mastering their skills, they motivated each other to keep focused and continue to improve, and most importantly they were excellent sportsmen throughout the entire week.”
