08 Homewares for the fashion-forward nature lover? Yes please 
We fell hard for Dinosaur Designs&apos; lust-have resin accessories, so it&apos;s a no-brainer that their homewares will be similarly sought after. Borrowing from the bounty and beauty of nature, Foliage is the latest homewares (and accessories ) collection from this talented team. Designed by Louise Olsen, one half of the hip couple behind Dinosaur Designs , the collection will have you rethinking your interiors styling - because your home will feel a little bit less without at least one of their new pieces. 
The collection spans platters and vases shaped like leaves with artistic ivory patterning plus bold vases that call directly on nature for their show-stopping good looks. Skeletons of leaves have been embedded directly into the resin for #officegoals paperweights. As for the colours?Think a soft spring palette of white, mint green, deep navy, warm earthy red and gold. Too pretty not to purchase. Foliage is available now from Dinosaur Designs&apos; Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane stores and dinosaurdesigns.com.au . Special
