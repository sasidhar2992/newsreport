London&apos;s Night Tube explained IBTimes UK &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/20034&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 
London&apos;s long-delayed night tube service finally kicked off over the weekend, and proved hugely popular. More than 50,000 people used the the Central and Victoria lines on the first night of service. One of the busiest stations was Oxford Circus which saw 6,500 people tapping in, while Stratford station saw 4,250 customers tapping out. 
Some passengers looked tapped-out as well, with quite a few slumped in their seats, and one man photographed apparently urinating on the tracks at Oxford Circus. IBTimes UK presents photos from the night tube&apos;s first weekend.
