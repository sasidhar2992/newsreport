 01   $A falls on rising US rate hike view AAP – 32 minutes ago Print 
The Australian dollar has fallen against its US counterpart, amid mounting market expectations of a rate hike in the US following some encouraging comments by the US Federal Reserve. 
At 1700 AEST on Monday, the local unit was trading at 75.97 US cents, down from 76.44 cents on Friday. 
US Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fischer flagged on Sunday that a 2016 rate hike is possible, noting the US economy is close to meeting the central bank&apos;s goals and that growth will gain steam. 
Mr Fischer&apos;s comments, plus the board&apos;s minutes meeting last week, suggest that we are &quot;probably closer&quot; to a potential rate hike at some point later this year, Westpac chief currency strategist Robert Rennie said on Monday. 
Westpac continues to forecast a US rate hike in December, Mr Rennie said. 
Investors will be closely watching US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen&apos;s comments at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, to be held in Wyoming on Friday, he said. 
Ratings agency Moody&apos;s decision last Friday to cut its rating outlook on Australia&apos;s major banks to negative from stable also continues to weigh on the Aussie.
