First Kiwi to publicly and legally bring medicinal cannabis into NZ 
Monday 22 Aug 2016 7:32 p.m. 
One in three New Zealanders will have cancer at some point in their lives and when you&apos;re sick, you want the best drugs. 
But if the best drugs are illegal, what can you do? 
If you&apos;re like Rebecca Reider, you go to Hawaii, buy your drugs there and walk straight back through New Zealand customs with them - bold, brass and completely within the law. 
She has become the first person to bring medicinal cannabis publicly and legally into the country. 
Ms Reider suffers from an undiagnosable chronic illness which gives her debilitating pain throughout her body. 
Story has been with Ms Reider through her whole journey.
