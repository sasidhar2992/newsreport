Ministries 
Home Groups Home Groups are the heart of Solid Ground. We meet in homes, coffee shops and apartments for the study of God&apos;s Word, fellowship and evangelism. 

Life Groups Life Groups meet in homes similar to Home Groups, however Life Groups have a defined start and finish as they engage in theological teaching or particular themes of study or sharing. 

The Tribe Solid Ground has a thriving group of God-stoked teens. All students aged 13 - 18 years are invited to be there on Fridays at 19:00 

Coolkidz Solid Ground reaches ALL kidz from ages between 2 years and 13 years. Coolkidz meet in different Zones every Sunday from 09:00 to 10:30. The Crew is the new meeting that takes place on Friday from 5:30pm to 7:00pm 

Sister Act We place value on womanhood as God does. Sister Act is where we love God, love on each other and where we celebrate life. Our passion is to see women of all ages flourish and be empowered to excel in every season in life. We have morning get-togethers as well as evening Sister Act meetings. The morning group come together every second Wednesday at Solid Ground Church, main auditorium, at 09:30-11:30. The evening group meet every second Tuesday at 18:30-20:30.
