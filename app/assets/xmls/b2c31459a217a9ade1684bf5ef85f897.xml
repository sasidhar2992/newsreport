Gonzalo Higuain has hit back at suggestions he is out of shape after scoring on his Serie A debut for Juventus. 
The Argentina striker finally made the switch from Napoli in late July after intense speculation last season&apos;s top Serie A goalscorer would join the reigning champions. 
Juve splashed out a reported €90million to prise Higuain away from the Stadio San Paolo and the 28-year-old began to pay back some of that fee with the winning goal in Saturday&apos;s 2-1 win over Fiorentina. 
However, his performance was overshadowed by criticism of his physique, with some media outlets suggesting he was carrying a few extra pounds, something he refutes and says gives him motivation to prove others wrong. 
&quot;It is better if you keep saying I&apos;m fat, [as] I will continue to score goals,&quot; he is quoted as saying by Tuttosport . &quot;Come on, I&apos;m fine, I have trained for 20 days and I honestly do not understand all this interest on my condition.&quot;
