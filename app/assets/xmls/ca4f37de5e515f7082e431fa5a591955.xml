Home / Coffee Planet unveils new single origin coffee Coffee Planet unveils new single origin coffee Kenya Thunguri is priced at US $14 (AED50) for 250g. 
Coffee Planet has introduced a new addition to its specialty single origin range. 
The new Kenyan single origin called &apos;Kenya Thunguri&apos; is a medium roast, and comes from one farm in Kenya. 
The UAE-based company said in a statement that it combines &quot;a honey sweetness with hints of orange blossom and juicy blackcurrants, followed by a rose tea finish&quot; and features specialty-graded, 100% Arabica coffee. 
The word ‘thunguri’ is a cultural reference, meaning ‘wet mill’ or factory in Kenya. 
Coffee Planet reported that its single origin range is growing, partly due to rising knowledge of sourcing techniques and origins among coffee drinkers in the Middle East.
