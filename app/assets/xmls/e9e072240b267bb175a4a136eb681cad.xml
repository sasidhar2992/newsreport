  View Comments Given how often popular opinion seems to change, it can be hard to keep track of what diets are actually good for you and which ones are completely bullshit. One thing however has stayed a constant for a pretty fair amount of time: don&apos;t eat a knife. Even more important than that: don&apos;t eat knives , plural. One knife is far too many for someone to eat, let alone, say, the 40 knives that one Indian gentleman with a particularly intriguing set of appetites decided to chow down on. It took doctors 5 hours to remove the knife collection (which he had been working on for around 2 months) from his guts, and, miraculously, he&apos;s apparently all good now. The surgery took place on Friday in Amritsar in Punjab and resulted in a (mostly) healthy, knife-free man. Dr Jatinder Malhotra , who lead the operation to de-knife the man, says the knives were in a variety of states: &quot;He says he swallowed some knives folded, and some unfolded. When we took out the knives -- some were found folded, some were open, and some had even started rusting and were broken.&quot; The man told doctors he had acquired a taste for metal and just loved the way the knives tasted. The doctors told him next time he feels like he needs some iron, maybe just eat some spinach.
