Eastern Washington fires destroy homes, force evacuations Updated 3:35 am, Monday, August 22, 2016 SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Firefighters are battling fast-moving wildfires in eastern Washington that have destroyed homes and forced hundreds of residents to flee. Three blazes in the Spokane region erupted Sunday afternoon, sending families rushing to pile pets and keepsakes into vehicles and hit the road. The Spokane Spokesman-Review reported ( http://bit.ly/2bHZgLr ) reported that homes burned in the Beacon Hill area of Spokane, in wheat country near Spangle and north of Davenport in nearby Lincoln County. But the extent of the losses and number of evacuees was unclear as firefighters prepared to work through the night and into Monday morning. No injuries have been reported. Together the three blazes scorched nearly seven square miles of terrain and sent plumes of smoke billowing over the region. ___ Information from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com Today&apos;s Deals
