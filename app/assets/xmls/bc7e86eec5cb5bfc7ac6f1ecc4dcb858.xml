Unread post by b_boy69sa » Mon Aug 22, 2016 9:55 am Hey everyone i&apos;m selling my gaming laptop. Here are the details.I&apos;m putting up my Lenovo Y50 for sale, it is the perfect machine for gaming at FHD on High Settings (Witcher 3, Fallout 4, Assetto Corsa). She is a slim and sexy beast that makes a perfect work/gaming/Flight Sim notebook. Battery is good for 4.5hrs of office work or watching 1080p Movies with JBL Sound and as a bonus the battery is BRAND NEW ORIGINAL 0 CYCLES along with everything inside. (Will provide a TON of Microsoft FSX addons for free if interested) The notebook has just arrived back after a motherboard issue (Hint: Do not run battery gauge resets on ANY LENOVO&apos;s, the software is faulty and can damage motherboard.) On the plus side they replaced all the internals for mahala and it was even after the one year warranty expired. Service and customer care was excellent. So internally it is a NEW laptop. Outside condition is Very Good some small scratches on outside case. Never been dropped and always traveled in a protected travel case. The specs are as follows.Item: Lenovo Y50 (i7 960m, 4GB GDDR5, 1Tb SSHD, 8GB DDR3, FHD)Age: Nov 2014 (But all internal components replaced and upgraded July 2016)Warranty: Expired but can be purchasedPackaging: Original Box
