NEW Ontario Man Pulled Over Drunk in CBS August 22, 2016 | 5:19 am Photo courtesy Earl Noble 
The RNC were quick to respond to reports of a drunk driver in CBS around 9:00 last night. 
Police tracked down the suspect and after a brief investigation, a 46-year-old Ontario man was charged with impaired driving, refusing the breath test, obstruction, and breaches of court orders out of Ontario. 
He also faces several breaches of the Highway Traffic Act. The man is in custody and will face the judge later today.
