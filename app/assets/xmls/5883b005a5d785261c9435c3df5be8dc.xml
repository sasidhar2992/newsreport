While consumers might scoff at nonrefundable rates, higher cancellation fees or earlier deadlines for cancelling reservations, hotel companies will continue to be aggressive in wooing them to book direct. 
The hotel industry has always been fairly generous with its cancellation policies. Until recently, the majority of hotels would allow guests to cancel their reservation without penalty until 6 p.m. on day of arrival. Customers appreciated it, but last-minute cancellations were always a burden on the hotel, especially on the person in charge of filling those lost rooms. One of the few options for hoteliers to fill late-vacated rooms is to sell the inventory on discounted channels and recover only a portion of the initial reservation. Today, with the availability of more comprehensive data sources, including cancellation information, there is increased scrutiny over just how much cancellations are costing hotel owners.
