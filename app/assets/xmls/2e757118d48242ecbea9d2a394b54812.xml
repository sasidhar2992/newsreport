Teen’s project is completed Verity Ward Have your say 
A project organised by a South Tyneside teenager who died after falling from a cliff has been completed. 
Chirelle Calder, from Whiteleas, South Shields, was taking part in the National Citizenship Service (NCS) scheme and had helped organised a sponsored walk to raise cash to buy care packages for victim of domestic abuse. Chirelle Calder. Picture supplied by family. 
Sadly, the 17–year–old died after falling from cliffs at Marsden in South Shields on Saturday, August 13 - before her mission was complete 
On Thursday Chrielle’s teammates handed over a number of packages to the Options charity in Beach Road, South Shields. 
Julie Robinson, the organisation’s co-ordinator, said: “Two weeks ago I received a call from a group saying they wanted to create support boxes. 
“These boxes were to contain things like toothbrushes, as often women and children will leave their homes with nothing. “I’d like people to know how hard they’ve worked.” Julie Robinson 
“Then the group, despite what’s happened, turned up to drop all of the boxes off. 
“We’re very grateful and I’d like people to know how hard they’ve worked when things haven’t been that easy for them.” 
Chrielle’s older sister Amy is also delighted that the team completed their task. 
She is also humbled by the amount that’s been raised on an online fundraising page. 
Amy, 19, from Stanley said: “I think Chirelle would have been pleased that the team continued on and created the packages. 
“The fundraising page which was started is doing really well. We’re up to just over £800 will is brilliant. 
“There’s also been a lot of nice messages left.” Sign in
