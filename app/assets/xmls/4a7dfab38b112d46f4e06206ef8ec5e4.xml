DEVELOPING Durant leads US to another basketball gold, 96-66 over Serbia Europe, Europa By our dpa-correspondent and Rio de Janeiro (dpa) - Kevin Durant is on fire as the United States trounce Serbia 96-66 in the basketball final for the last gold medal on offer at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.The 2014 NBA Most Valuable Player led the way with 30 points as the US overcame a sluggish first quarter by dominating the second 33-14 en route to a third gold in a row and 15th gold overall in the sport.Carmelo Anthony, the only US player with Olympic experience other than Durant, became the most successful Olympic basketballer with a third personal gold.The Serbs, beaten just 94-91 in the group game between the teams, had hoped for a similarly close contest but were only up to the task in the first quarter as they lost heavily against the US, as in the 2014 World Cup final which ended 129-92.Sunday‘s victory also perfectly ended the overall US showing in Rio where they had also won the first of 306 golds from shooter Virginia Thrasher and topped the final medal table with 121 medals from a 46-37-38 haul.
