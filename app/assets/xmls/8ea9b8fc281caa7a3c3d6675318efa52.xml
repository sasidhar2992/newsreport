Ahead of the upcoming GITEX 2016, Commscope has released its viewpoint on the trends leading the region&apos;s networking market.
The company highlighted the increasing popularity of data centres, cloud technologies, IoT applications, as well as smart buildings, as some of the key trends.
Fibre technology is also gaining ground for its capability in managing large amounts of data, rapidly and efficiently.
Commscope also highlighted the impact of Millennials and how they are driving how networks evolve, both as next-generation IT specialists, as well as end-users.
Ehab Kanary
, vice president of Enterprise, CommScope , Middle East and Africa . &quot;We are in the early stages of what may be the greatest transformation of networking yet, driven by mobility, video consumption and cloud. These consumer behaviours and technology trends are straining networks globally and require new thinking regarding infrastructure requirements of the future.&quot; &quot;The new CommScope is well positioned to address bandwidth needs through a convergence of network technology, including outdoor cellular infrastructure, small cells, distributed antenna systems, fiber optic connectivity and data centre infrastructure.&quot;
Joseph Habib
, vice president of Service Providers, CommScope , Middle East and Africa , said: &quot;Operators and enterprises across the Middle East are implementing the technology necessary to compete internationally and locally. They expect to collaborate, create and connect at any time. CommScope is taking the complexity out of managing networks that are changing faster than ever before.&quot; He added: &quot;Video-on-demand, online gaming, teleworking and e-Health services will undergo increased reliability as telecommunications companies invest in improving their networks&apos; capability of carrying large amounts of data.&quot;
