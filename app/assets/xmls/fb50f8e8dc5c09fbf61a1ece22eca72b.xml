SEATTLE, Wash. -- The noises that come out of Joel Romeo&apos;s mouth are less to deliver a message and more to get your attention. 
His method of communication is a unique mixture of sounds and hand gestures, a compensation created by the autism, partial deafness and muteness he lives with. 
&quot;Infamous for going to rock shows. He&apos;s at the record stores up to four times a day,&quot; said Max Wallace, a friend of Romeo&apos;s. 
&quot;People call him the Mayor of Ballard.&quot; 
Romeo has been a fixture in Seattle&apos;s Ballard neighborhood for years. However, he recently got a notice from his landlord that he had to leave his home of at least 15 years. 
Romeo&apos;s situation was first reported by The Stranger. 
Landlord Jim Olsen, who used Romeo&apos;s actual last name Abel, called him &quot;a wonderful guy&quot;, but added, &quot;it&apos;s not his home. It&apos;s my cottage.&quot; 
Olsen said his hand was forced by a recent inspection by the Seattle Housing Authority, which helps pay Romeo&apos;s rent. It determined the house needed several improvement to make it fit for habitation. 
Olsen indicated those repairs could not be made because of the accumulated junk, records and other items inside Romeo&apos;s home.&quot; 
&quot;I can&apos;t have my buildings be a liability,&quot; said Olsen. 
Stacy Gillett, Executive Director of The Arc of King County, said her agency provides 20 hours of support a week to Romeo. 
&quot;We hope to find a landlord in Ballard to take $1,000-a-month with vouchers,&quot; she said, &quot;The landlord issues were fixable.&quot; 
Meanwhile, Wallace has created a GoFundMe page to raise money for a storage unit for Romeo&apos;s belongings, and help find a place to live without jeopardizing his Social Security and state funding.
