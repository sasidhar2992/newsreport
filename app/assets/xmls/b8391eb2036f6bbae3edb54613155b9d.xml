Germany&apos;s interior minister Thomas de Maiziere wants facial recognition systems in the country&apos;s airports and train stations to identify terror suspects.
Europe has experienced a wave of attacks, many terror-related, over recent months, which has in turn triggered a heightened state of security.
De Maiziere told the German Sunday newspaper Bild am Sonntag he wants a system to match against intelligence databases of known terror suspects, something the country has resisted.
&quot;There are opportunity for individuals to photograph someone and use facial recognition software on the internet to find out if they have seen a celebrity or a politician,&quot; De Maiziere says.
&quot;I want to use such face recognition software on video cameras at airports and train stations.
&quot;Then the system will show if a suspect is detected.&quot;
De Maiziere cites video surveillance systems in place in German airports that detect luggage unclaimed after a set time.
&quot;The authorities must use technology they are legally allowed to use,&quot; he says.
The Interior Minister also told the newspaper he is in favour of a ban on backpacks at some festivals. Authorities have already banned backpacks at Munich&apos;s upcoming Oktoberfest beer bash, implementing regular ID and security checks and extra fencing.
De Maiziere says the controls restrict personal freedoms less than cancelling public events for security reasons. ®
