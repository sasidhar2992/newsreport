Cincinnati&apos;s long and rich beer brewing history has not always been properly preserved and celebrated. Many historic breweries have been demolished, and many once-famous brewery names have been forgotten. 
But today we are experiencing a resurgence of local breweries and a new-found appreciation for the city&apos;s brewing history. And plans are now underway to create a Brewing Heritage Trail that will tell the story of the many people and places that contributed to Cincinnati&apos;s brewing industry, which, in turn, contributed to the city&apos;s economic and social growth. 
Joining us to discuss the Brewing Heritage Trail are Steve Hampton , executive director of the Brewery District Community Urban Redevelopment Corp .; and Mike Morgan , founder and president of Queen City History &amp; Education Ltd. and curator of the Brewing Heritage Trail . Related Program:
