FTSE 100 bolstered by housebuilder shares 22 August 2016 Close share panel × Image copyright AFP (Open): The London market edged higher as trading began, with shares in housebuilders among the early risers. 
The benchmark FTSE 100 index rose 5.93 points to 6,864.88. 
Shares in Taylor Wimpey rose 1.6% while rival housebuilder Berkeley Group added 1.5%. Persimmon, which is due to release results on Tuesday, rose 1.1%. 
Gold and silver miner Fresnillo was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 3.9%, as the gold price fell to its lowest level for nearly two weeks. 
Elsewhere there was little company news about to move the market. 
Analysts will be eyeing the annual meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in the US later in the week. The speech from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen on Friday will come under particular scrutiny for any clues as the timing of a US interest rate rise. 
On the currency markets, the pound edged down 0.1% against the dollar to $1.3068 but rose 0.3% against the euro to €1.1584. Share this story About sharing Top Stories
