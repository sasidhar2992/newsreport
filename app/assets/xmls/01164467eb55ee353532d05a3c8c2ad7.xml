Beijing: : A 31-year-old Shanghai woman who fell off a cruise ship that was returning to China from Japan was miraculously saved after floating in the sea for more than 38 hours. The woman, whose name was not disclosed, was traveling with her parents aboard the ship on Wednesday evening when her companions noticed she was missing. She had gone for a walk on the deck at around 8:30 pm but didn’t return. Her parents and more than 100 volunteers searched the boat but failed to find her. 
Wang, a fisheries official in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, who saw the missing woman, said “She was in a stable condition when I saw her, with only minor injuries on her arms. The woman said she fell off the cruise ship while leaning over a 1.4-meter rail and gazing into the sea. The woman was rescued at about noon on Friday and was too weak to eat until dinnertime. She went home with her parents at around 5 pm on Saturday.” 
“Only after I heard my daughter’s voice did I believe she was still alive. It’s a miracle,” said her father.
