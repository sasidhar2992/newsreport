Jeweler Sues Insurer Over Diamonds Tossed in Garbage   
No insurance company likes to pay out a claim so it’s not surprising that they would go to such lengths to avoid certain claims. In this case, the policy, on the face of it, seems to cover accident and negligence (and hasn’t yet been denied), which is why the insurance company is going to great lengths to prove otherwise and why it has become necessary for the insured to press the insurer to act and settle the claim.
