Joe Hart to Everton and more Man City transfer rumours 08:45, 22 Aug 2016 The Manchester City goalkeeper looks likely to leave the club as his replacement nears on a move to the Etihad. Shares Comments Get Manchester City FC news by email 
Claudio Bravo is expected to sign for Manchester City this week in what will be a monumental blow to Joe Hart&apos;s hopes of ever becoming No.1 again. 
The England international has been relegated to the bench under Pep Guardiola, with former reserve Willy Caballero being picked for the first three games of the season. 
And Barcelona confirmed over the weekend that Bravo had a deal with City, before allowing him to skip training as a completed deal nears. 
The Telegraph write that a new goalkeeper is a priority for Ronald Koeman at Everton and Hart is now a &apos;realistic option.&apos; 
The Mirror report that with Bravo not available for Wednesday&apos;s Champions League game, Hart will not get a chance for a last send-off as he will remain on the bench. Read More Why Man City target Bravo is better than Joe Hart 
Away from Hart, West Ham have asked to take Wilfried Bony on loan. 
Andy Carroll has been ruled out for at least four weeks in the latest blow to the forwards department in East London, leaving Slaven Bilic seriously short of strikers. 
The Telegraph say that a move has been sorted for Bony to go to the Chinese Super League in January, but he could go on loan before then.
