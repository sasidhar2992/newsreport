THE FATHER of a soldier killed in Iraq is embarking on a sponsored walk to raise money for his charitable trust, which has helped one local veteran reach the Rio Paralympics. 
John Hyde, the father of Ben Hyde, a red cap killed in Iraq, is embarking on the start of a 150 mile walk around North Yorkshire to raise money for the Lance Corporal Ben Hyde Memorial Trust. 
Ben, a 23-year-old from Northallerton was one of six Red Caps killed when the police station they were guarding was stormed by a violent 400-strong mob in 2003. 
  Lance Corporal Ben Hyde Memorial Trust was set up by his father John in 2005 and has since raised around £100,000 for charity. 
His father is embarking on a 13-day walk to raise further funds, carrying a stretcher with a dummy of a wounded soldier. 
The trek, which began yesterday, started from Helmsley along the Cleveland Way to Sutton Bank. 
Over the next couple of weeks John Hyde and walkers Noele and Irene Christon will walk on to Osmotherley, Swainby, Carlton Bank, Kildale, Guisborough , Saltburn , Whitby and Scarborough and then follow the Tabular Hills trail back to Helmsley. 
Other volunteers will join them on the way. 
One of those to already benefit from the trust is Northallerton para-rower Laurence Whiteley, who is on the British rowing team for this summer’s Paralympic Games in Rio. 
Laurence, who is a member of Tees Rowing Club and a former winner at The Northern Echo’s Local Heroes Awards, was able to compete thanks to sponsorship from the trust. 
In 2011 he received a £1,500 grant when he was trialing for Team GB for the London Paralympics in Adaptive Rowing. Although he qualified for the team, he was unable to compete in 2012 because he didn’t have a rowing partner. 
In January 2015 he was found a suitable partner, Lauren Rowles. 
In August 2015 they competed in the World Championships in Italy, hoping to finish in the first five. 
They won silver after losing to the current world champion Australian team by half a second. 
As a result of qualifying Laurence had to buy his own boat, at a cost of £10,000. Team GB funded half the cost, but he had to find the remainder and the trust was able to award him £1,500 grant towards it. 
John Hyde said: “Because it’s his boat, Laurence could paint it whatever colour he wanted and he chose to put Ben’s name on it.” 
Since the trust was set up in 2005 it has raised more than £100,000 and has awarded grants to organisations including the Royal Military Police Benevolent Fund and towards a new strip for Northallerton Town FC. 
Anyone wanting to donate towards the Lance Corporal Ben Hyde Memorial Trust can donate up to £10 by texting BENS27 to 70070.
