With more than a third of hotel website revenue generated as a result of organic search engine referrals, SEO continues to be an integral piece to hotel digital marketing. 
With major search engines like Google changing their algorithms more than 500 times a year, as well as introducing new features and functionality that impact how search results appear on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), hoteliers must be as vigilant as ever in how they implement and adapt SEO strategies over the course of time. Hotel marketers must make data-driven decisions derived from careful analysis of measurable results and research. Industry best practices may evolve over time, and smart digital marketers must consider SEO as an ongoing effort grounded in hard data, but susceptible to volatility, and adjust their efforts accordingly.
