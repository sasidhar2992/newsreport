FEDERAL WAY, Wash. -- A man died in an apparent drowning at Wild Waves Water Park in Federal Way Saturday night, authorities say. 
South King Fire and Rescue says they were called to the park around 5:30 p.m. for a report of an unconscious man at the activity pool in the park. 
They say when they arrived, lifeguards had pulled a man in his 30s from the water and were performing CPR. Fire crews took over, but the man was not able to be revived. 
Wild Waves is working with authorities as the investigation continues. 
&quot;Our thoughts are with the family in this difficult time,&quot; Wild Waves said in a released statement Sunday.
