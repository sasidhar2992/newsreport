Mumbai: Actress Jacqueline Fernandez considers “Kick” a turning point in her life, and says before featuring in the Salman Khan-starrer, she lacked confidence. 
“Post-‘Kick’, things have changed. Since ‘Kick’, it has been great work (for me) and it has been good. The offers have been great too. I am hoping I just keep growing,” Jacqueline told the media here. 
“I think what went wrong before ‘Kick’ was… I feel I didn’t have any confidence before ‘Kick’. That was the only thing which went wrong. When I look back, I feel I didn’t have the confidence back then,” she added. 
“Kick”, released in 2014, had done well at the box office. 
The Sri Lankan beauty has been enjoying her tryst with commercial cinema in Bollywood. 
“It is extremely exciting. When you are a part of big commercial films, it’s an amazing feeling. Having back-to-back releases feels great. It is taxing as well. You have to be on it, be aware, be focussed… And it can get very taxing.” 
Jacqueline was recently seen in “Housefull 3” and “Dishoom” and now she is busy promoting her forthcoming entertainer “A Flying Jatt”.
