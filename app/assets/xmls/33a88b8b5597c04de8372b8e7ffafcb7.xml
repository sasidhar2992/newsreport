CT rolls out R60m ‘retrofit’   
The City of Cape Town is embarking on the next phase of its ambitious ceiling retrofit project which aims to warm up old State-subsidised houses which were previously constructed without ceilings. R60 million is earmarked for this phase. The city’s media desk reports 
22 August 2016 – To date, some 4 500 ceilings have been installed across the metro at a cost of approximately R83 million. This has also included the fixing of roof leaks and the installation of safer ceiling lighting. 
‘Earlier this week, I went to visit some of our beneficiaries in Vrygrond where we’ve spend about R26,2 million on the completion of 1 250 ceilings. One of our aims with this project was to warm up these homes and, from the feedback, it seems that this has been accomplished. Councillor Benedicta van Minnem, Housing Mayoral Committee Member in Cape Town 
‘We are starting with public participation for the next phase of this project shortly and we’ve earmarked a further R60 million in areas across the metro. 
‘It is hoped that we can continue to alleviate some of the discomfort that the beneficiaries of old State-subsidised houses – commonly referred to as RDP houses – have had to endure over the years. Our contractors and staff have performed exceptionally well and have mostly been markedly ahead of schedule,’ said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Human Settlements, Councillor Benedicta van Minnen. 
Having to live without a ceiling has caused much discomfort for residents who have been affected by the poor thermal performance of the homes, as well as condensation which gives rise to damp conditions and inferior internal air quality. 
Between 1994 and 2005, the majority of State-subsidised housing units were constructed without insulated ceilings and weatherproofing. This was because the then National Government subsidy did not make provision for this. After 2005, the housing subsidy was increased to provide ceilings, weatherproofing and partitioned bedrooms. In Cape Town alone, it is estimated that there are approximately 40 000 State-subsidised homes that do not have ceilings. 
Ceiling retrofitting has been completed in Eureka, Kalkfontein, Broadlands (Strand) and Lwandle, Vrygrond and Wesbank. 
Phase 2 includes the areas of Chris Nissen Park, Gordon’s Bay, Heinz Park, Macassar, Phumlani, Silver City and Sir Lowry’s Pass Village. The public participation process for these areas are commencing soon as buy-in and support from the beneficiaries are vital. 
Public participation dates are as follows: Phumlani Village on 25 August 2016 Silver City on 6 September 2016 Heinz Park on 8 September 2016 Gordon’s Bay Temperance Town on 20 September 2016 Sir Lowry’s Pass Village on 22 September 2016
