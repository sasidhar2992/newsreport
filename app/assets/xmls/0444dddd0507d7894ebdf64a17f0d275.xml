Union minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday said the Modi government at the Centre was committed towards spreading the ideals of freedom fighters among the present generation. 
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for spreading the ideals of freedom fighters, who had liberated the nation 70 years ago, among the present generation. 
As part of the campaign, we are visiting the birth places of freedom fighters across the country,” Goel said after visiting the birth place of Rash Behari Bose at Subaldaha village in Burdwan district. 
Paying rich tributes to the revolutionary, Goel said the government will preserve his memory and build a marble plaque if land was made available. 
He also went around the ruins of the freedom fighter’s birth place spread over several acres of land and spoke to villagers who demanded that it be developed as a heritage spot and be properly maintained. PTI
