VW says more than 25,000 workers, six plants hit by production problems Monday, August 22, 2016 3:05 a.m. EDT 
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen on Monday said production at six plants was impacted by interruptions with more than 25,000 workers affected, following a dispute between Europe&apos;s largest carmaker and two of its suppliers. 
Volkswagen will resume talks to seek a negotiated settlement with suppliers CarTrim, which makes seats, and ES Automobilguss, which makes cast iron parts needed to make gearboxes, the carmaker said. 
The suppliers are seeking compensation after saying they faced lost revenues running into tens of millions of euros after VW canceled a contract.
