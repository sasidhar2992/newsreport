Log In Sign Up Frank Ocean finally drops an album Fans have been asking Frank Ocean to release an album after four years of not releasing any music. The singer dropped his 17 tracks &quot;Blonde&quot; album on Saturday night which trended for the entire weekend. Mary Jane Mphahlele Embed The long anticipated album features artists such as Beyoncé (“Pink + White”), André 3000 (“Solo Reprise”), Kendrick Lamar, Tyler, the Creator, Pharrell, Kanye West, Jazmine Sullivan, and more. This is an album that will prove good music can still be made. This album also proves that Andre 3000 will be killed if he doesn&apos;t make a bloody album lol. #frankocean #goodmorning #goodmusic #blond #blonde #lovemusic #musiclover #musician #frank #3stacks #andre3000 #omg #music #musically
