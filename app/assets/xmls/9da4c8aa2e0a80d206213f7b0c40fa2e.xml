Medal of Honor Pacific Assault, can&apos;t install.. Medal of Honor Pacific Assault, can&apos;t install.. by DuckHuntYOLO Float this Topic to the Top Bookmark ★★★★ Newbie ‎08-22-2016 12:21 AM 
Hello, that would be a problem that I have had a few years ago the original game, the game is played, but when the patch I screwed up and tried to wipe the game, but posted the installer error. Somehow we managed to solve the missing files, so I was able to delete off, but when I install it will not accept the code printed on the frame.
