Syngenta on Monday was tightlipped on the agreement it has clinched with a U.S. national security panel to approve its blockbuster takeover by ChemChina but said any concessions it made to secure the go-ahead would not be significant. &quot;We are not disclosing the details of the agreement with CFIUS to respect the confidentiality of the process,&quot; a Syngenta spokesman said by email in response to a Reuters query. &quot;Any mitigation measures are not material to Syngenta&apos;s business.&quot;
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) cleared ChemChina&apos;s $43 billion takeover of Swiss pesticides and seeds group, the two companies said earlier, boosting chances that the largest foreign acquisition ever by a Chinese company will go through.
