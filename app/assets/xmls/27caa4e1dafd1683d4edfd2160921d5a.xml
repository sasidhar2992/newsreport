For some industry experts, hotels have to either become low-cost leaders and go “ridiculously” select by charging guests for ancillary services and amenities or they have to go in the opposite direction and do something “truly differentiated” and exclusive. 
For Hyatt, it’s Hyatt Place and Hyatt House. For Hilton, it’s Tru by Hilton. For Choice Hotels, it’s Cambria. All of these brands fall under the select-service umbrella. These hotels may not have all the bells and whistles that full-service hotel has, like a spa or full-service restaurant, but they do have the basic amenities that most travelers - business and leisure - want in a hotel stay. They’re not exactly upper-upscale, but they aren’t necessarily economy, either; instead, they generally fall into that upscale/midscale price range. “I think this is one of those asset types that can please both business and leisure travelers,” said Guy Langford, vice chairman of U.S. travel, hospitality, and leisure leader for Deloitte. “They’re not so basic. Instead of it being limited service, they call them ‘select.’ They provide services to you in specific areas where you have demand. You don’t need a fancy restaurant, so you can book on OpenTable nearby so they have a gym instead, for example. From my perspective, select-service hotels do a better job of satisfying both business and leisure, especially in terms of the [economic] softness we’ve been seeing lately.” Get the full story at Skift Vizergy Daily Newsletter Join our 45&apos;000+ subscribers and stay on top of industry news and trends with the premier must-read daily for hotel marketers delivered right into your inbox.
