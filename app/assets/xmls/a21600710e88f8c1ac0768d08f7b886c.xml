Avoid Perth petrol price rise This announcement is for: Consumer Business / company Motor industry 
The average cost of unleaded petrol is set to increase by around 20 cents per litre (cpl) to 122.4 cpl tomorrow, so FuelWatch is encouraging Perth drivers to fill up today to save money. 
FuelWatch advises that on Tuesday 23 August 2016, most Puma and Caltex sites are increasing their ULP price to 129.9 cpl (an increase of 31 cpl by Puma and 27 cpl by Caltex). Most Caltex Woolworths sites are increasing their ULP price to 126.9 cpl, most Coles Express and BP sites to 124.9 cpl and most United sites to 123.7 cpl. 
Perth’s weekly petrol price cycle results in prices, on average, being cheapest on Sunday and Monday and at their most expensive on Tuesday and Wednesday – that’s why we recommend filling up today. 
If you need to fill up tomorrow, use FuelWatch as there are still 30 sites selling below 104 cpl. The difference between the highest and lowest priced sites is 37 cpl, which means you can save up to $22 on a 60 litre tank of fuel. 
Monday’s cheapest ULP is available for: 96.9 cpl at Puma Gingers (Upper Swan) in the East; 92.6 cpl at Coles Express Brookdale, Coles Express Canning Vale and Coles Express Casuarina in the South; and 92.6 cpl at Coles Express Duncraig in the North. 
Tuesday’s cheapest ULP will be available for: 103.9 cpl at BP 2go Morrison Road (Midvale) in the East; 92.6 cpl at 7-Eleven Haynes, Coles Express Brookdale, Coles Express Canning Vale and Coles Express Casuarina in the South; and 92.6 cpl at Coles Express Duncraig in the North. 
Drivers can head to the mobile compatible www.fuelwatch.wa.gov.au site to find the cheapest fuel in their area. Log on after 2.30pm each day to compare today’s and tomorrow’s prices. You can also sign up for free emails along with the 37,000 others who benefit from daily updates. Alternatively, phone 1300 30 40 54 .
