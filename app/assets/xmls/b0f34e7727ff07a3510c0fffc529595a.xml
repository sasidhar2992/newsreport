NSUARB hearing in Truro on CCRSB&apos;s proposal to adjust boundaries of its electoral districts 8/22/2016 
The Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board is holding a hearing in Truro on the local school board&apos;s application to confirm the boundaries of its electoral districts. 
The province&apos;s Education Act requires the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board to apply to the UARB every eight years to confirm or change the number of district-elected school board members and the boundaries of the electoral districts. 
Back in June, the UARB approved the school board&apos;s request to retain its current structure of 15 district-elected board members, plus a regionally-elected African-Nova Scotian member and a provincially appointed First Nations member. 
The school board is proposing some changes to the electoral boundaries, based on changes in a number of local municipalities and counties and voter parity. 
Monday&apos;s hearing starts at 10 a.m. at the school board office on Lorne Street.
