12:31 PM, August 22, 2016 / LAST MODIFIED: 12:41 PM, August 22, 2016 SC stays top militant’s bail 0 Copy this link Star Online Report 
The Supreme Court today stayed for three months the High Court order that had granted bail to an alleged coordinator of banned militant outfit Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) in two cases. The cases were filed with Uttara West Police Station on May 24, 2015 and Cantonment Police Station on May 31, 2015 under anti-terrorism act 2009 on charges of planning to carry out subversive activities against the state. Fida Muntaseer Shaker was shown arrested in the cases on June 18 and July 12 last year respectively. Following two petitions filed by Shaker, the HC on June 16 this year granted six months’ bail to him in the cases. Today, the five member bench of the Appellate Division headed by Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha stayed the HC’s bail order for next three months. The apex court passed the order following a petition filed by the government seeking a stay on the HC order. Additional Attorney General Momtajuddin Fakir told The Daily Star that Shaker cannot get released from jail following the SC order. Detectives arrested Shaker in the capital&apos;s Banani DOHS area on June 7, 2015.
