By Mark Heyne • 5 minutes ago Share Larry Tye&apos;s new book tells of Robert F. Kennedy&apos;s transformation from cold warrior to liberal icon. 
Robert F. Kennedy is remembered as a racial healer, a defender of the poor and a progressive champion of the Sixties. But Kennedy&apos;s political journey began in the conservative Fifties. In his new book, &quot;Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon,&quot; author Larry Tye chronicles Kennedy&apos;s transformation from cold warrior – he began his public life as counsel to the red-baiting senator Joseph McCarthy – into fiery liberal. We spoke with Larry Tye about Robert Kennedy&apos;s life. Related Program:
