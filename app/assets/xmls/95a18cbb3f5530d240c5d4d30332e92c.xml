JOHANNESBURG – South Africa’s rand weakened against the US dollar in early trade on Monday, hurt by subdued risk appetite as investors began to price in a greater likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.
At 0615 GMT, the rand trades at 13.5950 versus the dollar, 0.5% weaker from its New York close on Friday.
The dollar strengthened on expectations that a signal might emerge from a Federal Reserve gathering this week that the US central bank is gearing up to raise interest rates.
Locally, market focus is on consumer inflation data due on Wednesday.
Government bonds also weaken, with the yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 adding 4 basis points to 8.515%.
