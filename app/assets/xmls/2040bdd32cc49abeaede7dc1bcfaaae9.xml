Mp_cn812 August 12, 2016 Weekly Cotton Market Review Spot cotton quotations were 69 points lower than the previous week, according to the USDA, Agricultural Marketing Service�s Cotton and Tobacco Program. Quotations for the base quality of cotton (color 41, leaf 4, staple 34, mike 35-36 and 43-49, strength 27.0-28.9, uniformity 81.0-81.9) in the seven designated markets averaged 72.06 cents per pound for the week ended Thursday, August 11, 2016. The weekly average was down from 72.75 cents last week, but up from 60.92 cents reported the corresponding period a year ago. Daily average quotations ranged from a high of 75.06 cents Friday, August 5 to a low of 69.58 cents Wednesday, August 10. Spot transactions reported in the Daily Spot Cotton Quotations for the week ended August 11 totaled 4,061 bales. This compares to 2,321 bales reported last week and 7,207 spot transactions reported the corresponding week a year ago. Total spot transactions for the season were 6,064 bales compared to 9,406 bales the corresponding week a year ago. The ICE October settlement prices ended the week at 71.27 cents, compared to 75.86 cents last week. Prices are in effect from August 12-18, 2016 Adjusted World Price (AWP) 64.69 ELS Competitiveness Payment 0.00 Loan Deficiency Payment (LDP) 0.00 Fine Count Adjustment 2015 Crop 0.50 Coarse Count Adjustment (CCA) 0.00 Fine Count Adjustment 2016 Crop 0.60 Source: Farm Service Agency, FSA, USDA Regional Summaries Southeastern Market Spot cotton trading was inactive. Supplies were light. Demand was light. Average local spot prices were lower. Trading of CCC-loan equities was inactive. Variably clear to overcast conditions were observed across much of the lower Southeastern region during the period with daytime high temperatures in the mid-80s to mid-90s. The crop advanced under seasonably warm conditions. Widespread thundershowers brought several inches of beneficial moisture to areas along the Gulf Coast. Further inland, shower activity brought lesser totals of trace amounts to around 1 inch of moisture to cotton growing areas throughout Alabama and south Georgia. Target spot disease has appeared in fields in the Florida panhandle and in areas along the Gulf Coast that have received heavier moisture accumulations in the last two weeks. Producers were monitoring disease development in fields and considering treatment options. In the wettest areas, fruit shedding has become a concern due to damp and overcast conditions; boll-rot and hard locking in the bottoms of older plants could also be compounded if wet conditions continued. Producers were actively scouting fields and treatments were underway for stink bugs, and to a lesser degree, plant bugs in fields that justified treatment. Growth regulators were applied to control rank growth. Scattered thundershowers brought up to 3 inches of moisture to areas throughout the Carolinas and Virginia during the period.The crop benefitted from the widespread moisture and advanced under seasonably warm daytime temperatures in the mid-90s. Boll-setting was at or ahead of the five-year average in the Carolinas, but lagged a week to ten days behind in Virginia. Local experts reported bollworm activity was heavier in the upper Southeastern region and producers were finding them present in fields that were scouted for stink bugs and plant bugs. South Central Markets North Delta Spot cotton trading was slow. Supplies of available cotton were light. Demand was light. Average local spot prices were lower. Trading of CCC-loan equities was inactive. No forward contracting was reported. Hot, humid weather conditions prevailed during most of the period. Heat advisories remained in effect with heat indexes in the 100s. Overnight lows were in the low 70s. Scattered, late afternoon thundershowers brought some moisture to isolated locales; less than 1 inch of precipitation was reported. Early-planted fields were rapidly approaching cut-out and therefore no longer requiring irrigation of insect control measures. Fields that had not reached cut-out were treated for bollworms, plant bugs, and fall armyworms. Producers continued to irrigate wherever necessary to maintain normal plant development. Plant growth regulators were applied in a few cases. The crop made excellent progress under hot conditions, except in Missouri where the crop advanced slowly. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Crop Progress report released August 8, boll opening was at 5 percent in Arkansas and 1 percent in Tennessee. No open bolls were reported in Missouri. Boll setting had reached 56 percent, but was behind the five-year average of 71 percent. NASS also reported that the crop was in good-to-excellent condition in Arkansas and Tennessee and fair-to-good condition in Missouri. Local experts reported widespread boll shedding, but added that yield potential remained very good. South Delta Spot cotton trading was inactive. Supplies of available cotton were light. Demand was light. Average local spot prices were lower. Trading of CCC-loan equities was moderate. No forward contracting was reported. A series of heavy rain showers brought up to 3 inches of rain to the region during the period, with 7 to 10 inches reported in isolated areas. Flooding was reported in low-lying locales. More rainfall was in the forecast for the days ahead. After an extended period of hot, dry weather, producers were hoping for more dry weather the avoid boll rot in mature cotton fields. Many fields are rapidly approaching cut-out. Insect pressure from bollworms has been moderate; fields were treated as necessary to control infestations. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Crop Progress report released August 8, boll opening had reached 8 percent in Louisiana and 6 percent in Mississippi. NASS reported that the crop remained in fair-to-good condition. Southwestern Markets East Texas-Oklahoma Spot cotton trading was inactive. Supplies were light. Demand was moderate. Average local spot prices were lower. Trading of CCC-loan equities was slow. Forward contracting was light. Foreign mill inquiries were moderate. Interest was best from India and Pakistan. In the Rio Grande Valley, harvesting neared completion and ginning was active. Modules had accumulated on gin yards. Ginning was expected to continue into the fall because of the good yields. Defoliants were applied in the Upper Coast. Harvesting continued in the Coastal Bend and around Corpus Christi. Most of the gins had initiated operations. Gins in the Upper Coast will begin the week of August 15. Southern Kansas received beneficial rainfall that helped the crop advance. Some fields had begun to bloom and have a good fruit set. Large bolls were reported. Hoe crews manually removed resistant pigweed. Industry experts reported 2,4 D drift in western Kansas. In Oklahoma, stands were blooming and setting bolls. Heavy fruit loads were reported. Experts monitored for bacterial blight outbreaks. Spotty rainfall helped to alleviate heat stress. Industry members were encouraged with crop advancement. Insect populations were light in Kansas and Oklahoma. In east Texas, industry experts reported that squares were shedding and plants were wilting under triple digit temperatures. No significant rainfall was received and some fields were blooming at the top of the plant. West Texas Spot cotton trading was inactive. Supplies and producer offerings were light. Demand was light. Average local spot prices were lower. Trading of CCC-loan equities was active. Forward contracting was light. Foreign mill inquiries were moderate. Interest was best from India and Pakistan. Intermittent thunderstorms moved across the territory and deposited up to 5 inches of moisture on some fields, mostly in the panhandle and Southern Rolling Plains. The storms were not widespread, but producers are hopeful with higher chances of rainfall in the nearby forecast. Irrigated stands advanced and dryland fields were at different progress levels. Most fields were at early or peak bloom, and at high water use. Some fields had reached cut-out and plants were shedding fruit. Wilting was reported as daytime temperatures were in the upper 90s and low 100s. Fields were scouted for insect thresholds and plant diseases. Reoccurring regional meetings were attended. Western Markets Desert Southwest (DSW) Spot cotton trading was inactive. Supplies and demand were light. Average local prices were lower.

The crop progressed and relief came in the form of rain in fields across central and eastern Arizona, New Mexico, and El Paso, TX. Reports indicated that up to 3 inches of precipitation were received in Arizona, and light amounts in New Mexico. The additional moisture reduced heat stress and helped to supplement irrigation water. No damage was reported, but experts were monitoring for disease and insect populations. In Yuma, defoliation continued and ginning was expected to begin in two weeks. Temperature highs in New Mexico moderated into the upper 90s, and along with intermittent rain showers, heat stress was lessened. The crop progressed as expected. Irrigation continued. San Joaquin Valley (SJV) Spot cotton trading was inactive. Supplies and demand were light. Average local prices were lower. No forward contracting or domestic mill activity was reported.
