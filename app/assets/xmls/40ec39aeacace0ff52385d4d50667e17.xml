GameCentral for Metro.co.uk Monday 22 Aug 2016 8:52 am PlayStation 4 Slim – just one of Sony’s new consoles this year 
Sony will be revealing not one but two new consoles in September, with pictures of the PS4 Slim already appearing online. 
Officially Sony hasn’t said what their PlayStation Meeting in New York is for, on September 7, but the general assumption is that it’s to unveil the upgraded PlayStation Neo console. But that’s not quite right: it’s also for the PlayStation 4 Slim. 
Rumours of a ‘slim’ model started to appear over the weekend, including multiple pictures of a boxed version of the hardware and apparent confirmation of the console via The Wall Street Journal . 
That would make the new model the equivalent of the Xbox One S, but there’s no confirmation that it will have support for HDR or 4K video streaming – only that it’s smaller and probably cheaper.

The best picture of the console (most of the initial photos seem to have been taken with a potato cam) comes from website The Verge , and clearly shows a new matte finish and rounded edges. 
There’s still no indication of what the slim model actually does though, or if that’s even what this is. 
Technically it could be the PlayStation Neo, but the fact that the box doesn’t say anything about more power (just a small 500GB hard drive) makes that unlikely. Especially as The Wall Street Journal article clearly states there are two different consoles coming. 
With the PlayStation VR also launching this year, that is a lot of new hardware for Sony to be releasing in just a few months. But we’ll probably have to wait till September 7 for the full details. @notaxation @GameOverGreggy Seen this for sale in my local classifieds. What do you think? Ps4 slim? pic.twitter.com/ZLvwh8DRsn
