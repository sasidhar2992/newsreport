Islamabad: In a shocking incident, a 22-year-old Pakistani man went on a misogynistic killing spree, stabbing 17 women from January this year until this month. He admitted of being tormented and pushed to take this extreme step, as his stepmother ill-treated him that induced hatred for women. 
All the attacks took place in the streets of Rawalpindi, adjacent to Pakistan’s capital Islamabad. 
Mohammad Ali said to the police of Rawalpindi that his murders were fueled by hatred for his cruel stepmother and, so he was taking ‘revenge’ by blindly targeting women of any age on the streets. “He would wait on the streets and attack whenever the opportunity arose. His last victim was a hospital nurse, who died this week,” said a police official.
