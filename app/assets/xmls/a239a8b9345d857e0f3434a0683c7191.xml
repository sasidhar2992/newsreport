No injuries as train carrying coal derails in rural Texas By Associated Press | August 21, 2016 @ 6:47 pm Tweet 
ROANOKE, Texas (AP) — Officials say no one was injured when a train hauling coal derailed in rural North Texas, sending some cars into a creek. 
Union Pacific spokesman Jeff DeGraff says 26 cars derailed off the end of a southbound train around 6:30 p.m. Sunday in the city of Roanoke, about 30 miles north of Fort Worth. Some of those cars fell into a creek below a bridge. 
DeGraff says it wasn’t immediately clear what caused the derailment. Union Pacific crews were responding to investigate and begin cleaning up. 
Roanoke Police Det. Sandy Pettigrew tells the Fort Worth Star-Telegram there is no threat of hazardous materials leaking into Denton Creek, which feeds into Grapevine Lake. 
Police in nearby Flower Mound were diverting southbound traffic on U.S. highway 377 near the scene.
