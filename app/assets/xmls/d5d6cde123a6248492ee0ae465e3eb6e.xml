Browse Channels Hungry Bear Wanders Through Family Backyard 
Florida resident Angie Pope was left bewildered by the sight of a bear in her backyard on August 11. She wondered aloud what she could do to scare off the uninvited guest. The bear seemed to be looking for food, and she had to shoo him away from her tomatoes. The family dog was trapped inside the house the whole time, and didn’t seem too enthused by the new visitor in the garden. Credit: Facebook/Angie Pope Loading the player ...
