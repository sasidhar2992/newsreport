Marriott is perfecting the art of doling out real-time rewards by targeting social media users mentioning the brand and offering them loyalty points that are instantly added to their accounts, resulting in a 100 percent conversion rate. 
Marriott joined forces with conversational conversion platform Chirpify’s Reply Rewards solution, which allows brands to surprise and reward social media users for their activities with various perks, thereby deepening customer relationships and driving repeat purchases. The hotel chain has been targeting Marriott Rewards members posting about its resorts on Twitter by proactively contacting select individuals and gifting them with complimentary loyalty points that are instantly added to their accounts. “Unlike other programs, Marriott hasn’t just ported its program information to mobile channels, it has created an altogether new way to surprise and delight Marriott Rewards members,” said Chris Teso, CEO of Chirpify. “We worked hard to ensure that what guests love most about Marriott – that it goes out of its way to ensure guests are welcome and feel at home – was brought into the social and mobile experience. “The campaign has seen such high mobile engagement because Marriott is effectively surprising and delighting its loyal customers at the right time with the right reward that encourages timely engagement,” he said. nSight Daily Newsletter Join our 45&apos;000+ subscribers and stay on top of industry news and trends with the premier must-read daily for hotel marketers delivered right into your inbox.
