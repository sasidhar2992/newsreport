The Anti-Corruption Commission today prayed to the High Court to fix a date for hearing an appeal filed by former president HM Ershad against his three years’ jail sentence in a corruption case in 1992. Khurshid Alam Khan, a lawyer of the commission, moved the prayer with the HC for hearing the appeal for its swift disposal. A Dhaka court in 1992 convicted Ershad, also Jatiya Party chairman, in the graft case and sentenced him three years in prison for misappropriating Tk 1.91 crore by misusing power while he was the president of the state. Ershad the same year filed an appeal with the HC challenging the lower court verdict.
