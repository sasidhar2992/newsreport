Whitney Cummings Calls Cops on Neighbor For Tree Hatchet Whitney Cummings to Neighbor You Killed My Trees But You Can&apos;t Stump the Cops 8/22/2016 12:55 AM PDT BY TMZ STAFF EXCLUSIVE 
Whitney Cummings is livid at a neighbor who she claims went all Paul Bunyan in her backyard, and now cops are investigating. 
We&apos;re told Whitney walked in her backyard this week and was horrified to see a tree massacre, courtesy of her neighbor&apos;s gardener. 
Seems the neighbor was frustrated that Whitney&apos;s wall of bark was blocking his view, and she says he ordered the landscaper to do a hatchet job on her property ... cutting the trees down to stumps. 
Whitney called the cops, who came out and took a felony vandalism report ... she claims the damages total around $36k. 
Sources tells us the neighbor offered to pay Whitney something, but it&apos;s unclear how much. 
We spoke with the neighbor, who had no comment. We also reached out to Whitney, but so far no word back.
