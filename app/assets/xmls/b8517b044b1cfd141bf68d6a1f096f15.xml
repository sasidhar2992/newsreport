Ray Donovan Mega Buzz: A Sad Life Is Coming to a Sad End   22, 2016 at 12:01 AM By TV Guide Posted Aug. 22, 2016 at 12:01 AM Sunday&apos;s episode of Ray Donovan was full of mayhem and murder, with both Mickey ( Jon Voigh t) and Ray ( Liev Schreiber ) putting more check marks on their lists of fools who need to be smoked. But if you thought this week was crazy, hang on, because someone else is getting sent to the morgue next Sunday. Catch up on all this week&apos;s Mega Buzz! Who&apos;s it going to be? This character has been a perpetual thorn in everyone&apos;s side for a while, causing all kinds of problems for Ray and the crew. It&apos;s someone we want to root for as much as we loathe them, and whose death will be a relief as much as it will be the catalyst for a whole new set of problems when the body turns up in an unlikely place.
