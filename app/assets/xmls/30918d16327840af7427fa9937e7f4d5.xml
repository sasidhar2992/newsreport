Mumbai: Ram Gopal Varma says the Sarkaar Raj actors, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, will not return for the third installment of the film franchise. 
The couple was featured together in the 2008 film “Sarkar Raj”.Varma posted on his Twitter page on Saturday that. 
“‘Sarkar 3’ first look will be launched on August 26. Going by the story, both Abhishek and Aishwarya will not be featuring in this segment.” 
“Scale of Sarkar 3 will be much more larger and intense than the earlier two… Rest of the cast details will be soon announced,” Varma further wrote. 
In 2005 Sarkar’s first series was released in which Amitabh Bachan was seen playing the protagonist. It is still not clear whether Big B will return for the upcoming thriller. 
Verma also said that the first look of the film will be launched on August 26.
