NEW Friends Miss $34-Million Jackpot by One Number August 22, 2016 | 5:15 am Last Updated:August 22, 2016 | 5:17 am 
Aaron Bennett and Billy Earle of St. John&apos;s are still wondering what if, after almost winning a $34-million lottery jackpot. 
The friends regularly go in on lottery tickets together and on Friday night it almost paid off. They missed the Atlantic Lottery Super 7 jackpot by one number. They matched six of the seven numbers, which means they will have to split $5,116.50, not the $34-million had they matched all seven. 
It&apos;s a feeling Billy Earle knows all too well. A few years back, he and another friend, who had been buying tickets together for five years, forgot to pick up their tickets. Their numbers came up and they missed out on a $6-million prize. 
Bennett posted a picture of the ticket on Facebook, with the caption &quot;feeling sick - maybe next week.&quot; This Friday&apos;s top prize jumps to $46-million and the pair say they have already bought their tickets.
